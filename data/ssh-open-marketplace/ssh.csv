There is a treasure trove of potential sitting in your unstructured data. Customer emails, support tickets, product reviews, social media, even advertising copy represents insights into customer sentiment that can be put to work for your business. The question is how to get at it? As it turns out, Machine learning is particularly good at accurately identifying specific items of interest inside vast swathes of text (such as finding company names in analyst reports), and can learn the sentiment hidden inside language (identifying negative reviews, or positive customer interactions with customer service agents), at almost limitless scale.

Amazon Comprehend uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech; and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. You can also use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organization's needs.

Privacy and sharing settings allow for fine-grained control over access to files and materials stored on the platform - share privately with collaborators or publicly with the community at large. Each project, contributor, and file on the OSF is given a persistent unique identifier, making all research products citable. The platform also mints DOIs and ARKs through DataCite. A collaborative wiki allows contributors to work on writing materials simultaneously.

API connections with other services (Github, Dropbox, Box, Dataverse, Google Drive, figshare, Zotero, Mendeley, Amazon S3) allow researchers to connect other services they already use in order to see all their materials in one place.

The display can be customized in the several ways. Node colours, shapes and sizes can be altered. More significantly, the layout of the graph can be chosen from amongst several different algorithms.  

As the collection is quite large, there are many filtering options available. In terms of author, the following categories can be specified: gender, author/non-author, and author nationality. The user can create complex search queries of the authors and the text, and specify a date restriction for the authors' life span.  

Each association in the text has been tagged with one or more semantic attributes, i.e. the type or meaning of the relation between the people. These tags have been organized into a tree, moving from general to more specific relations. Each tag in the tree can be checked/unchecked, further filtering the results.  

Finally, a data set and customizations can be saved as a session which can then be loaded at a later time. In addition, screenshots of the current layout can be saved to an image file.

Participad has three modules:

Dashboard -- The Dashboard module puts Etherpad editors into the WordPress Dashboard. Participad removes the \"Visual\" and \"HTML\" tabs from the standard WP editor, and replaces them with a \"Participad\" tab.

Frontend -- The Frontend module allows users to edit WordPress content from the front end of your website -- no Dashboard required. Participad modifies the Edit links on your posts and pages so that, instead of leading to the Dashboard, the static content of your post is swapped with an editable Etherpad window.

Notepad -- The Notepad module enables a new WordPress Post Type called Notepads. Notepads are collaborative note-taking documents, which can optionally be linked to existing static posts or pages. Participad provides several shortcodes and widgets that make it easy to create new Notepads from the front end of your website.

N.B. Participad requires a separate Etherpad Lite Installation.

It documents books published in Poland in Polish and other languages as well as books published abroad in Polish and other languages when they pertain to Polish writers or when their author is Polish.

The service is curated by the PBL team — the Department of Current Bibliography of the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Pracownia Bibliografii Bieżącej Instytutu Badań Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk). The department has operated in Poznań since 1948. The „Polish Literary Bibliography” publishing series has been printed since 1954, with 45 annuals published by 2000, containing materials for the years 1944/45–1988. The printed volumes of the PBL have been digitalized and they are available in the public repository. 2001 was a breakthrough year for the presentation of the materials from the „Polish Literary Bibliography” as it saw the launch of the online PBL database, available at www.pbl.ibl.poznan.pl and spanning the years 1989–2003. 

For every year the PBL team examines approx. 850 periodicals: nation-wide dailies; domestic literary, cultural, and cultural-social periodicals; series published by scholarly institutions; selected émigré press titles; and foreign scholarly journals devoted to the subject matter of Slavic countries. A significant percentage of these records are also annotated. An important aspect of the PBL tradition is that it is a bibliography of not only texts, but also theater, film, radio, and television works (when connected with literature or theater) and also that it keeps indexes of people, institutions, works, series, and periodicals.",NA,NA,780,"113575597226772854643@google.com","Magdalena Wnuk","enabled","2022-10-14T07:52:55+0000","moderator",FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Jednokratnu financijsku potporu dala je Zaklada Adris 2016. godine u okviru projekta koji je prijavljen pod nazivom Znameniti i zaslužni Hrvati.

Cilj je projekta uspostaviti temelj za okupljanje i objedinjeno pretraživanje metapodataka digitalne građe hrvatskih kulturnih, umjetničkih i znanstvenih ustanova izgradnjom portala Znameniti.hr s digitalnom građom velikana hrvatske kulture, znanosti, umjetnosti i javnog života iz različitih zbirki/repozitorija. Svrha je projekta omogućiti veću dostupnost i korištenje nekomercijalnih znanstvenih, kulturnih i umjetničkih digitalnih sadržaja istraživačima i široj javnosti.

U prvoj fazi projekta na portalu su prikupljeni podaci iz zbirka četiriju ustanova koje su ujedno i pokretači projekta, a tematski su vezane uz hrvatskog povjesničara, književnika, političara i bibliofila I. K. Sakcinskog. Potom se pristupilo prikupljanju metapodataka ostalih znamenitih osoba.

U drugoj fazi izgradnje portala projektu su pristupile i ostale ustanove koje u svojim digitalnim zbirkama/repozitorijima posjeduju vrijedne priloge o znamenitim ličnostima hrvatske prošlosti i sadašnjosti: Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža, Institut za etnologiju i folkloristiku te Muzej za umjetnost i obrt.

Promoted features include connecting with communities who share your interests, learning from users who work in your field, the ability to share your discoveries with friends, and taking a \"deep dive on any topic.\"

According to Aria Haghighi, one of the founders \"...we have an architecture similar to a search engine: polling and crawling the open web and activity on social networks.\" A 2013 article on Slate.com refers to Prismatic as \"the world's smartest news reader\". It's a good addition to other search and curation tools such as Google Alerts and saved Twitter hashtag searches.

The software is designed to aid in the analysis of all types of Western music using established analytical techniques, including tonal functional analysis (Harrison 1994), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), hierarchical linear analysis (Schenker 1935, Jones 2002), tonal pitch-space analysis on the Tonnetz (Riemann 1915), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), and transformation analysis (Lewin 1987). Musical works and excerpts may be opened and saved using the de-facto standard music notation interchange format, MusicXML. To assist in analysis, Ptolemaic can display the music on a pitch/time graph, on a pitch-class/time graph, on a step-class/time graph (also called a diatonic lattice) (Jones 2002), on the Tonnetz, or using filtered point-symmetry (Douthett 2008). Pitch classes and chords are color coded so that the user can easily correlate them across each graph. The benefit of having a software tool to visualize and perform certain analysis tasks is in automating processes that are normally time-consuming for the musician, thus allowing the music scholar to focus on the musical issues, rather than the technical issues of graphing, and calculating chord classes. Ptolemaic provides useful ways of visualizing a piece of music and tools for gaining more information about that music, so that the user can efficiently make informed musical decisions about the music and preserve that analysis for future study.

It addresses the long-standing and usually ignored problem that the single quotation mark and the apostrophe are indistinguishable in plain text files. It replaces the following characters with separate symbols that are not already in the text: 
- Internal apostrophes: presumably real apostrophes 
- Non-internal apostrophes preceding capital letters: usually scare quotes or dialogue marked with single quotation marks 
- Non-internal apostrophes following a word-final \"s\": usually plural possessives 
- Non-internal apostrophes in very commonly used contracted forms: 'em, an', 'twas, and so forth

RusDraCor comprises 80 plays, GerDraCor holds 465 plays at present (late December, 2017), but we will be growing both text collections throughout the next year. Featured authors of RusDraCor so far are Blok, Bulgakov, Chekhov, Fonvizin, Gogol, Gorky, Gumilyov, Krylov, Lermontov, Mayakovsky, Ostrovsky, Plavilshchikov, Prutkov, Pushkin, Sumarokov, Leo and Aleksey Tolstoy and Turgenev. German authors are too many to be listed here.

Our main purpose is the social network analysis of these dramatic texts: we extract social situations by collecting information on who is talking along with others in a given segment of a play (acts, scenes, other constellations). Via an API, we offer structural information, which we can analyse with a variety of tools. This website gives you the opportunity to explore the social structure of individual plays.

The analytical part for this page was done by Ivan Pozdniakov in R and is presented by help of the web application framework Shiny, hosted on our own server.

I´m pleased to announce the release of SibMEI 1.0, a Sibelius to MEI plugin. Currently it only exports to MEI from Sibelius (no import). Special thanks to Micah Walter for his work on it this summer.



You can download it from the GitHub \"Releases\" page: https://github.com/DuChemin/sibmei/releases



To install:



- Download the plugin (either .zip or .tar.gz)

- Quit Sibelius if you have it open

- Place the \"sibmei\" folder in your Sibelius plugins folder. See this page for help on how to find this folder on your system: http://www.sibelius.com/download/plugins/index.html?help=install

- Restart Sibelius. The plugin should be available in your Plugins drop down bar.



To use, simply choose \"Export to MEI\" from your plugins list.



If you find any bugs, please help out by filing an issue on the GitHub Bug Tracker: https://github.com/DuChemin/sibmei/issues.



The development of this plugin was supported by two organizations:



- The Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) sponsored the initial development through a visiting research position at the University of Virginia;



- The DuChemin Project, led by Richard Freedman at Haverford College and funded by grants from the NEH and Haverford College, sponsored further development in the summer of 2013.



Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

The application can be used to create and author Voyager SVX Documents. Documents are files in JSON format containing the description of a Voyager scene or experience.

Voyager Story can be operated in several different modes. Each mode offers a number of tasks.

QC Mode

- This mode is aimed at 3D technicians. After a model has been digitized and processed into derivative assets ready for web consumption, QC gives you the following tasks and tools:
- Pose task: center the model and put it into upright position
- Capture task: take a 2D snapshot of the model
- Derivative inspection task: inspect the quality of the meshes and textures at various levels of detail
- Settings task: adjust parameters such as material settings

Edit Mode

Along with the QC tasks, edit mode allow authoring tools to be used to stage the model(s) using lights, cameras and props, and to add content (annotations, articles, and tours) to the experience. The following tasks are available in edit mode:

- Annotations task: add annotations to specific 3D locations on a model
- Articles task: write and edit articles (documents with text and media), and connect them with annotations and models
- Tours task: create guided tours which guide through the experience in multiple steps

Expert Mode

Voyager Story actually offers a third mode, called expert mode, which shows all available tasks at once. It also provides a detailed view of all document elements and settings. The expert mode is aimed at - well - experts and developers.

Standalone Mode

By default, Voyager Story requires a WebDAV file server backend to facilitate saving Voyager files directly to your permanent storage location. If you spin up Voyager from the source (instructions here) a simple server is included. Otherwise, you are responsible for appropriately accessible file storage.

Standalone mode removes the file server requirement by saving Voyager scenes in browser memory and gives you the option to download the complete package directly to your machine. You can try out our deployment of it here: Voyager Standalone

SPPAS is daily developed with the aim to provide a robust and reliable software. Available for free, with open source code, there is simply no other package for linguists to simple use in both the automatic annotations of speech, the analyses of any kind of annotated data and the conversion of annotated file formats. You can imagine the annotations or analyses you need, SPPAS does the rest!

SPPAS ensures flexibility rather than a one-size-fits all approach in the implementation of the proposed features. There are no fixed or unique solutions, but a bunch of customizable features to make choices according to the user requirements.

Annotating recordings is very labor-intensive and cost-ineffective since it has to be performed manually by experienced researchers with many hours of work. As the primary functionality, SPPAS proposes a set of automatic or semi-automatic annotations of recordings. In the present context, annotations are \"defined as the practice of adding interpretative, linguistic information to an electronic corpus of spoken and/or written language data. \"Annotation\" can also refer to the end-product of this process\" (Leech, 1997). SPPAS automatizes the annotation processes and allows users to save time. In order to be used efficiently, SPPAS expects a rigorous methodology to collect data and to prepare them.

Linguistics annotation, especially when dealing with multiple domains, makes use of different tools within a given project. This implies a rigorous annotation framework to ensure compatibilities between annotations and time-saving. SPPAS annotation files are in a specific XML format with extension xra. Annotations can be imported from and exported to a variety of other formats including Praat (TextGrid, PitchTier, IntensityTier), Elan (eaf), Transcriber (trs), Annotation Pro (antx), Phonedit (mrk), Sclite (ctm, stm), HTK (lab, mlf), subtitles formats (srt, sub), CSV files…",NA,NA,1,"Administrator","Administrator","enabled","2021-05-28T15:28:06+0000","administrator",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Srophé App is an open source database designed to support digital humanities research in the history of culture. Srophé [pronounced, Srō-Fay] is an eXist-DB application which enables researchers to encode and link historical data, with a focus on texts, persons, geography, events, and material artefacts. The Srophé App was created as the digital publication platform for Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal and thus its original use case was pre-modern cultural heritage data associated with the Syriac language (a dialect of Aramaic). Because the Srophé App architecture is built on the broad XML guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative. (TEI) and the principles of Linked Open Data, the Srophé app has also proved useful for digitally representing data from a variety of cultures across different time periods ranging from the architecture of medieval China to the geography of early modern South America to nineteenth-century British literature (soming soon). The app is capable of handling many kinds of data including full text literary corpora, encyclopedias, online journals, geographical gazetteers, prosopographies, and annotated bibliographies (building its functionality on top of Zotero).

Funding for the Srophé App has been provided by The Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the International Bazan Prize Foundation, Vanderbilt University, Texas A&M University, and Marquette University. The Srophé App is developed by the team of researchers in Vanderbilt University's Digital Heritage Research Cluster and the Center of Digital Humanities Research at Texas A&M University. The lead developer is Winona Salesky.

Addtionally, a number of supervised machine-learning methods are available via the function classify() (Delta, support vector machines, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, nearest shrunken centroids). The rolling.delta() function analyses collaborative works and tries to determine the authorship of fragments extracted from them. The oppose() function performs a contrastive analysis between two given sets of texts: among other things, it generates lists of words significantly preferred and avoided by one or more authors in comparison to the texts by another author (or a set of them).

SurveyCodings covers the following variables: occupation, industry, levels and fields of education, region, food groups, religions,  cost of living, and marital status, all coded according to ruling standards.  

The coding sets use standard classifications to organize and code information and to enable input harmonization at data collection stage resulting in more consistent data, especially for cross-national data  collection. Our services aim at developing solutions for fast high quality cost-effective cross-national harmonized coding for key variables. The coding tools use  a  dictionary  containing  tens of  thousands  of  entries about job titles, industry  names, religions, and fields of education. In addition, we provide country-specific, structured lists of educational qualifications, religious denominations and occupations. The code frames are provided using international standardized classifications, so that they can be used in cross national surveys such as SHARE, ESS, EVS, GGP, ISSP. 

These coding sets can be used for respondent’s self-selection or interviewer’s selection during computer-assisted survey. It is also possible to use the coding sets as a resource for post-coding of the answers, e.g. of open-ended questions in order to achieve harmonized comparable data. To have a closer look at the different coding sets, the webpage provides a database live search separately for each variable and a demo questionnaire including all variables.

It supports cellular automata, agent-based models, and network models running in 2D cell spaces. TerraME provides an interface to TerraLib geographical database, allowing models direct access to geospatial data. Its modelling language has in-built functions that makes it easier to develop multi-scale and multi-paradigm models for environmental applications.



Two important innovations in TerraME are its use of anisotropic spaces and of hybrid automata models. Anisotropic spaces arise when modeling natural and human-related phenomena. For example, land settlers in a new area do not occupy all places at the same time. They follow roads and rivers, leading to an anisotropic pattern. Anisotropic spaces are implemented in TerraME using Generalized Proximity Matrices (GPM). The GPM is an extension of the usual definition of the spatial relations and include a combination of neighborhood measures in the absolute space and in the relative space.



A hybrid automaton is an abstract model for a system whose behavior has discrete and continuous parts. It extends the idea of finite automata to allow continuous change to take place between transitions. Adopting hybrid automata in spatial dynamical models allows complex models which include critical transitions.

Although the feature set is now well developed, an inexperienced user should still be able to use it relatively easily. It is not intended only for the expert managers.

The key features of the application are therefore as follows:

1. The ability to read text, XML, or parse the contents of PDF or online content (HTML). Binary (Microsoft Office) files are included in the professional version.

2. A set of filter operations that can be applied in sequences, saved and retrieved.

3. A set of folders can be used as default locations for all of your related data. The application runs locally only, there is no requirement for a remote server.

4. A grid or tabular format allows you to view database queries, or for operations over specific columns or cells. A log file might have a standard format that can be queried, or conversion to CSV might be required, for example.

5. An analysis panel allows you to select single or groups of files and compare the content based on known clustering algorithms. Also some basic statistical counts.

6. Basic search from a toolbar, or more complex search operations from a Query form. The search facilities allow you to find information from different views and query types.

7. A separate Organiser application allows you to store your online links or local files, into ordered books and categories that can also be searched over. This allows for querying most of the available information, including keywords, descriptions, notes and content.

8. A Bookmarks form displays a list of ordered file references or links, for any type of file. You can open one of your commonly viewed files or links through a single click.

It is especially useful for maintaining lexical data, and for parsing and interlinearizing text, but it can be used to manage virtually any kind of data. Toolbox is free to download and use.Toolbox is especially powerful for handling large corpora and dictionaries. It can handle a corpus of over a million words, and a dictionary of hundreds of thousands of words

At heart, Toolbox is a text-oriented database management system (DBMS) with added functionality designed to meet the needs of a field linguist. The underlying DBMS offers full user flexibility in the design of any type of database. But for ease of use, the Toolbox package includes prepared database definitions for a typical dictionary and text corpus.

Toolbox also has powerful linguistic functionality. It includes a morphological parser that can handle almost all types of morphophonemic processes. It has a word formula component that allows the linguist to describe all the possible affix patterns that occur in words. It has a user-definable interlinear text generation system which uses the morphological parser and lexicon to generate annotated text

For instance, it can analyze a novel and tell you the proportions of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, or of Afroasiatic origin. First-generation and second-generation language ancestor data is included, and the output is highly granular, allowing the scholar to see the origins of individual words, and statistics about each ancestor language. This data can be useful as a particular type of topic modeling, since some macro-etymological data have have been correlated with particular genres, as well as the ages and sexes of their authors and/or speaking characters.

The distinct features of the system include: management and administration of semantic relationship types within thesaurus concepts, ease of navigation among interconnected terms, extensive search capabilities, multiple presentation displays of concepts and their context and more. THEMAS can be adjusted to fit the needs of any domain of research, through customizable system configuration options for: the activation / deactivation of integrated consistency controls, the user interface language, the thesaurus dominant language, the set of translation languages, the customization of graphical representation and so on. The workflow control offered by the system harnesses well defined user roles in order to facilitate the orderly evolution of the managed thesauri. It allows for the collection of knowledge from a large number of users, while smaller groups of users with domain expertise in the target thesaurus can be assigned responsibility for the approval, correction or rejection of any contribution, thus ensuring data correctness and thesauri consistency. Thesauri data – either as a whole thesaurus or as a result of an arbitrary search – are made available to users online and all thesauri data are exportable in machine-readable form in order to enable their easy integration into diverse information systems deploying thesauri. The system provides XML import, export, and SKOS export, and can also provide on demand SKOS import. The internal schema used is generally more detailed and flexible than SKOS.

The senior members of the THEMAS development team have extensive experience in thesaurus management projects going back to 1998. Some of the notable projects run by the team include: SIS-TMS, a multi-lingual thesauri management and development system, Aquarelle, an information system managing distributed multimedia information of cultural heritage, Semantic Index System (SIS), a tool for describing and documenting large evolving varieties of highly interrelated data, concepts and complex relationships. These projects have been developed in collaboration with a number of internationally renowned organizations including Getty Research Institute, English Heritage, the Greek National Centre for Documentation. Recently, we are also leading the thesaurus management working group of the DARIAH European Research Infrastructure a collaboration of 17 European countries aiming at the development of infrastructure for digital research.

THEMAS was developed within project DARIAH Crete: Development of Greek Research Infrastructure for the Humanities ΔΥΑΣ and was used within DARIAH European Research Infrastructure. Its design and development were based on the results from previous projects, such as Aquarelle, SIS and SIS-TMS, and from the experience gained from the collaboration with internationally renowned organizations such as the Getty Research Institute, the English Heritage and the Greek National Centre for Documentation, as mentioned earlier.

THEMAS was developed according to the principles that were developed and evolved during the aforementioned projects. This ensures that future development work will allow THEMAS’ extension with useful functionalities supported by the underlying model such as management of thesauri interrelationships, ad-hoc presentations of arbitrary views of the network, release management etc.

THEMAS is therefore a unique tool for the analysis of the logical structure and consistency of thesauri and a world class solution for consistently managing a set of correlated terminology resources for classification and data access in a distributed environment.

The software itself is offered as an Open Source solution. Our experienced team offers consulting, maintenance, migration, integration and adaptation service to clients upon request and at standard labour rates.",NA,"",207,"09da271bfff10ccaabbadcb52fca13fe7c75125b25e03adf8544aaa4635364f2@dariah.eu","Stefan Buddenbohm","enabled","2021-09-21T07:55:06+0000","moderator",FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"33a32c81-d9b5-44f0-85de-6c84d1a98238","image","thesaurus_header_login_en.png","image/png",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It overcomes the rigidity of relational databases by using semantic technology. In the simplest use case, a group of users can collaboratively edit information and upload files from any device with a web browser and an internet connection. Development time ranges between 1 and 8 hours.



By designing and implementing services, the data can be manipulated, transformed and aggregated through an virtual object oriented programming interface driven by the data model. This allows sophisticated use cases where different user groups with different rights are presented a completely different application working on the same database. In these cases development time ranges between 2 and 20 days.



A Topincs online database can be rented for a monthly fee. Topincs provide all services related to an online database: data modeling, programming, and support. They have special rates for educational institutions. Topincs can also be used as a Platform as a Service where the dark art of Topincs modeling and development must be studied online. The underlying semantic technology, Topic Maps, is taught there through hands on examples and will change your view on information technology.

Features of T-PEN through version 1.2 \[from project blog\]

Zoom Tool in Transcription User Interface: Holding CTRL+SHIFT will result in a magnified image of the current line being transcribed.

Magnifying Tool in Full Page View: Click on \"Magnify\" button at the top right of the browser window and a magnifying glass tool will appear as the mouse pointer. Click on the same button to dismiss the tool. The magnifying tool is also available in the Compare Page feature.

Create a Project \"Pipeline\" to the outer world: In partnership with The Carolingian Canon Law Project (CCL), T-PEN developed a model for enabling users working on transcription projects in T-PEN to export their work to a larger, external project. In this instance, the CCL prepared for T-PEN an XML-markup template (XML button set) that may be used for all transcriptions destined for the CCL database. Users identify their T-PEN projects as destined for the CCL, and when the transcription is complete, they can submit it from T-PEN to the CCL project. The CCL receives notification of the stable URL in T-PEN that the CCL can (either manually or by automation) use to extract the designated transcription from T-PEN's data store. Other projects interested in creating their own pipeline should contact T-PEN via t-pen.org

T-PEN Administration: T-PEN administrator can clear registration requests that have not been approved (ones that were mostly generated through internal testing).

Transcription UI: The previous line text will scale to the size of the screen. When on the first line of the page, available text from the last line of the previous page will be shown.

Visual Cue for Closing Tag Proximity (Transcription UI): Closing tags originating on previous pages are faded to indicate their distance from the current line of transcription.

Transcription Preview: The preview tool now applies a simple color filter to to allow for a more clear view of your transcription.

New Project Option Tools: Users can add a French/English dictionary, a dictionary for Middle English and the Dictionary of Old English (subscription required). User can select which tools will be available in the Transcription UI's i-frame. All tools can also be renamed by the user on the project management page.

Exporting Transcriptions: When exporting xml, users can select or deselect all the tags for inclusion at once.

Line History (Versioning): T-PEN distinguishes between all versions of any transcription line. Users can view previous versions of a given line. A change in a line is defined as addition or deletion of a single character (including white space) or modifications to the line parsing coordinates. A previous version can be selected to replace the current version. All versioning activity is recorded in the project log, which can be viewed on the project management page under the Collaboration tab.

It provides you with an interface to create and test these sequences of transformations before running them in batch mode on a set of files.Transformer was created to assist in the rescue of textual data from obsolete file formats such as DOS word-processor files. Sometimes, it proves impossible to rescue old data through normal means such as running the original application and exporting to a format which can be imported by a more modern program. Perhaps the program which created the data no longer exists or cannot be run on available hardware, or perhaps it cannot save to any format but its own. In these circumstances, it is often necessary to rescue the data by a process of manual conversion, identifying blocks of text or other data in the original file which can be replaced with Unicode characters, and building sequences of replacement operations which gradually convert the data. This often requires an exhaustive trial-and-error approach in which transformation operations are added incrementally and tested in various sequences before a reliable sequence is developed; then the sequence can be run on a group of files. Transformer should provide as efficient a working environment as possible, so that the user can focus on the task itself rather than the machinery.

The traditional approach of a humanities scholar is to put the texts of several editions next to each other and mark the differences among the textual entities (e.g., sentences, sections, chapters). Since this is an extremely laborious approach many Digital Humanities projects investigate tools that support the humanities scholars with computational methods.

TRAViz is a JavaScript library that was developed within the Digital Humanities project eTRACES. It generates visualizations for Text Variant Graphs that show the variations between different editions of texts. TRAViz supports the collation task by providing methods to:

- align various editions of a text

- visualize the alignment

- improve the readability for Text Variant Graphs compared to other approaches

- interact with the graph to discover how individual editions disseminate

The user can choose to process texts manually, selecting a candidate replacement offered by the system; automatically, allowing the system to use the best candidate replacement found; or semi-automatically, training the tool on a sample of the corpora.

The tool is designed specifically for Early Modern English spelling variation, but it can be used to deal with possibly any form of spelling variation, in any language, by plugging in your own dictionary and spelling rules.

It is often the case that a tool relies on one or more annotation layers to exist in the input data before it can begin processing. WebLicht can assist the user in building a processing chain by determining which tools are able to operate on the data at any given point and offering only those tools as options to add to the chain. There are 2 modes for building tool chains: Easy Mode lets you choose pre-defined processing chains Advanced Mode allows you to build customized tool chains. 

Login is required to use the tools and corpora. Login with email addresses from most recognized European universities will be automatically accepted.

Each tool within WebLicht is registered in a repository containing information about its input requirements and its output, among other things. This information is necessary to determine which tools can be added to the processing chain at any given point while building a chain because each tool in a processing chain uses the output of the previous tool in the chain as its input. Only those tools which are able to work with the data are available as choices for adding to a chain. The main focus of this Quick Start Guide is on WebLicht's web application and how it can be used to linguistically annotate text and subsequently to visualize the annotations.

WissKI is part of the open source content management system Drupal and therefore provides all the advantages of a constantly maintained and developed webapp. WissKI has everything to fulfill the research data lifecycle: beneath the fundamental possibilities to create, read, edit and delete content, users can create revisions and translations, open the access to the data with a wide range of interfaces and integration options, but also restrict it via detailed rights management. The data is stored in an external triple store, reachable trough own endpoints and therefore independent from Drupal or WissKIs architecture. The data modelling follow an ontological approach, preferably, but not exclusively according to the CIDOC CRM. Furthermore, the basic functions of WissKI can be extended with a variety of Drupal modules. This turns WissKI to a software optimized for research data management, and suitable for a wide range of application areas.

WissKI started as a joint venture of the Digital Humanities Research Group of the Department of Computer Science at Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) in Erlangen, the Department of Museum Informatics at the Germanic National Museum (GNM) in Nuremberg and the Biodiversity Informatics Group at Zoological Research Museum Koenig (ZFMK) in Bonn.

1) check the number of results (how often the chunk appears in Google Books or the Web);



2) compare the number of results (if your selected chunk appears more or less frequently than suggestions from online);



3) see examples in context (display several examples of how your selected chunk is used in different texts);



4) find words in context (see which words are used most often in your context, which you specify in your text by a star. For example, 'research should addingFilenamesPH.sh mergeTaporJason.sh this issue' will give you a list with 'research should address this issue', 'research should explore this issue', 'research should examine this issue', etc.);



5) find synonyms in context (see which synonyms of a word are used most often in your context, with you specifying the word you want synonyms for by two stars. For example: 'a \*difficult\* situation' will suggest 'an awkward situation', 'a serious situation', 'an embarrassing situation', etc).







The app works with a small popover which mean you can activate it from whatever writing tool you're using. No need to change windows - no interruption of your workflow.

Where previously research groups would have to agree on a single environment to work collaboratively and share their data, the Bamboo Person Service can allow group leaders to indicate which scholars in the Bamboo Person Service should have access to a set of data, which will then become accessible for each of those people in the environment of their choosing.

The Bamboo Person Service also provides mechanisms for making contributions to projects easier to document (e.g. to present to tenure and review committees), by keeping track of which individuals are doing curation work on corpora, or contributing entries to Bamboo DiRT. As the Bamboo Person Service develops, it may be integrated with social and scholarly networking sites, to allow scholars to opt into sharing the tools they use, as part of their profile.

For tool developers and collection holders, the Bamboo Person Service can reduce the time and development effort that would go into writing custom authentication and authorization, and can facilitate quality control in crowdsourced projects by keeping track of the curator assessments made about the validity of individual users' additions.

The BBT is an overarching meta-thesaurus for humanities research data. It offers top-level-concepts (facets and hierarchies) that serve as the common ground for thesaurus building. It relies on a faceted classification, which is considered valid and consistent from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Among the major advantages of such a classification, is its potential expansion into new scientific domains in a sustainable and manageable fashion. It is important to underline that the BBT, explicitly does not require domain experts to abandon their terminology in the name of some universally accepted terminology. Rather, the core feature of the BBT is that it promotes alignment of cutting-edge terminology to well-formed general terms of the meta-thesaurus capturing general meanings. This enables collaboration and cross-disciplinary resource discovery, while ensuring compatibility with thesauri that cover highly specific and developing areas of knowledge. By design, not only can the BBT function as an overarching thesaurus for the humanities, to be used by a gradually growing community of thesauri maintainers, but it can also evolve into a distributed federated thesaurus, bringing together several specialist thesauri, under one common scheme.

It aims to integrate the features of bookmarking systems as well as team-oriented publication management. BibSonomy offers users the ability to store and organize their bookmarks and publication entries and supports the integration of different communities and people by offering a social platform for literature exchange.



Both bookmarks and publication entries can be tagged to help structure and re-find information. As the descriptive terms can be freely chosen, the assignment of tags from different users creates a spontaneous, uncontrolled vocabulary: a folksonomy. In BibSonomy, the folksonomy evolves from the participation of research groups, learning communities and individual users, organizing their information needs.



Publication posts in BibSonomy are stored in the BibTeX format. Export in other formats such as EndNote or HTML (e. g. for publication list creation) is possible.



The service was developed by a team of students and scientists working at the Institute of Knowledge and Data Engineering and is hosted by the University of Kassel in Germany.

CLARIN metadata aims at describing language resources. In particular, they are meant to map and harmonise metadata from various centres in the Virtual Language Observatory (VLO). Translating such metadata and their definitions allows to describe in many languages the different resources in the VLO, developed by different researchers from different countries, and to pursue the harmonisation intent with a multilingual approach. In this way, non-native English speakers will be able to describe their resources more easily, as they can adopt their own language. Similarly, SSH researchers will be able to find and access such resources in a simpler way.

The  CCR  232  approved  metadata  and  their  definition  are  translated  into  four  languages, namely Dutch, French, Greek and Italian.

Cos4Bio has been developed within the European Horizon 2020 Cos4Cloud project whose main objective is to improve citizen observatories technologies to help them increase the quantity and the quality of observations and, finally, to help ensure their long-term viability. Cos4Bio allows citizen science experts to view and identify all observations from a single place, interacting with the community and contributing their knowledge about each species. When an observation has been identified in Cos4Bio, this information is updated in the citizen observatory where it was published, awaiting final validation according to the algorithm defined in each observatory, in some cases, these validation algorithms require a Some degree of experience, but in others several identifications of the same observation are required to validate it definitively. The file of each observation can be seen by entering the detail of each one of them. # Main advantages - Reduce the time that citizen science experts spend on the identification process and therefore on citizens observatories. - Allow users to download observations from one portal without forgetting that the platform will recognize and notify each observation's authorship. - Train much better algorithms than if we have separate databases with only the partial information of a single citizen observatory. # Infographic !\[Cos4Bio\](https://cos4cloud-eosc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cos4Bio_Infografia-1024x723.png)","bineo.cos4bio",NA,1,"Administrator","Administrator","enabled","2021-05-28T15:28:06+0000","administrator",TRUE,202,"EOSC Catalogue","https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/","https://providers.eosc-portal.eu/api/resource/{source-item-id}","","ee27fb7b-c3b2-49fa-96b5-12a23c07863c","image",NA,"image/svg+xml",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://cos4bio.eu/assets/icon/logo.svg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since most interactions only involve a single dimension, and then only small adjustments are made to the filter values, incremental filtering and reducing is significantly faster than starting from scratch.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE COLLECTION REGISTRY?
- To describe distributed collections in one place and to process them together in other services (e.g., Generic search, Cosmotool);
- to make collections visible in the Collection Registry which are otherwise difficult to find;
- to document own collections and make them demonstrable for other scientists;
- to be able to manage relevant collections in the sense of an internal catalog.

WHO IS THE TARGET GROUP FOR THE COLLECTION REGISTRY?
- Individual scientists
- Research projects

The Data Modeling Environment (DME) is a tool for modeling and associating data. By means of the DME, data models and mappings between them are defined and provided in terms of interfaces (REST-API). Integrative services such as the generic search access data models and mappings of the DME and utilize them for further processing, transformation and integration of data. A special feature of the DME is that data can be modeled regardless of its disciplinary context, its degree of structure and complexity, and its further use. Thus, in addition to standards such as [TEI](https://dme.mww-forschung.de/dme/model/editor/5f69fc384c7b040386a9239c/), [MODS](https://dme.de.dariah.eu/dme/model/editor/5a2e893061432f28f8254523/) and [DataCite](https://teaching.clariah.de/dme/model/editor/5eb11e106117b10b7b6c7c11/), data models and mappings of the DME also adress local and specifically developed schemas for which, for example, compliance with FAIR principles is to be achieved. The particular powerfulness of the DME with regard to the modeling of complex research data of the humanities and cultural sciences is based on the language-based approach to the definition of complex data and the associated explication of domain knowledge.

The DME source code is available under an open source license: https://gitlab.rz.uni-bamberg.de/dariah/dme

The [Generic Search](https://search.de.dariah.eu/search/?lang=en) creates a comprehensive search facility in DARIAH-DE. For this purpose, the individual metadata records of the collections described in the Collection Registry are combined. The Generic Search is available free and without registration.

With the myCollections function, users can create their own individual selection of these collections and save them permanently. This allows researches in a precisely defined environment. An \"own\" search engine created this way can be shared with other users.

The Generic Search combines the features of breadth-first and depth-first search so that a dynamic adaptation of the search - e.g. in regards to a faceting - but also the application of different visualization techniques becomes possible. The Generic Search allows a detailed examination of the considered data (depth-first search). With a growing number of included collections, the granularity of the consideration and the faceting of the search can be reduced and assume the form of a breadth-first search.

It can be used for exploring the content of a corpus as well as generating content-related features for computational text classification. Topic modeling thereby relies on the analyzed texts themselves entirely; it does not use additional sources of information like dictionaries or external training data, making it largely independent from language and orthographic convention. It is based solely on a statistical analysis of symbol co-occurrence (on word level) that is translated into likely semantic relationships. Hence, topic modeling is, in terms of its requirements on text type and text quality, one of the more flexible methods in computational text analysis.

The TopicsExplorer is a beginner-oriented Software allowing interested researchers to experiment with topic modeling on their own computers, with their own text corpora. The entire necessary work flow from plain text to visualized results - some of them even visualized in interactive graphs - is done in a graphical user interface (GUI). The software thus allows users without programming skills to load a collection of plain-text or even .xml files and to analyze it by means of the LDA algorithm. It is implemented as a standalone software that runs on common Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems without installation. As a result, users can scan texts for re-occurring, semantically meaningful groups of words; they can explore how much each of these semantic groups contribute to each text, and which texts probably share the same common themes and topics. For further analysis with other softwares, results can be exported in the universally readable .csv format.

The TopicsExplorer is primarily designed as an educational tool for both classroom and self learner use.

The CFW is here to help.

*What this tool is:* The aim of the CFW is to support humanities researchers within the European Union in obtaining valid consent for data processing in the context of their specific professional activity. This tool will guide you through a questionnaire that will consequently generate a GDPR-compliant form for obtaining consent from data subjects, tailored to your specific purpose and the data categories you intend to collect.  Please be aware that the validity of the generated output will be dependent on the truthfulness and accuracy of the input you provide. Honest and comprehensive answers will improve the quality of the results generated by the tool. After answering the questionnaire, the CFW will output a consent form template specifically tailored to your needs according to your answers in plain text format. You will be able to use this text template for creating consent forms to print out and have signed by data subjects, or to include in online environments. Since we will not store the generated output ourselves, please make sure to save your generated consent form at a location of your choice. If you want to provide your result as an example for other CFW users, please send it to us at eldah@dariah.eu. 

*... and what it is not:* The consent forms provided by this tool will observe the Articles of the GDPR. In some instances, the tool will recommend that you obtain additional legal advice.

12,59,48596,"tool-or-service","DH Press","OKoqgh","2023-01-27T16:02:24+0000","approved","DH Press (originally called diPH) is a toolkit conceived as an easy-to-use WordPress plugin which allows potentially every kind of user to visualise and mashup historic and geographic information, documents and various types of multimedia content to develop digital humanities project.

The user cannot start from the toolkit itself, as the first step to set up a project, when the toolkit is already installed, is a CSV import. This means that the raw information has to be processed first, through any software like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet, following some conventions dictated by the toolkit, and once completed must be exported in CSV format. The file can then be imported into DH Press.

At this point, the user finally has full control over the data. First, the toolkit needs to be informed of what kind of data is in each column, as it can handle various types, such as Short Text, Long Text, Lat/Lon, Date, and Link. The steepest learning curve resides here, in the data management part, as the database must be set up very carefully, and fixing any problem later is complex. This does not mean that new users cannot approach the tool, but some basic research on data management is required to make correct use of it.

After setting up all this fields, called \"motes\" in the toolkit, a legend can be assigned to each of them, for example a field called \"city\" might contain, through multiple entries, ten different cities, and to each of those will correspond the colour chosen by the user. It is also possible to assign icons or png images instead of colours.

A single control panel then allows the user to create, set up and manage multiple visualisations of different kind, and in each of them the user can choose which information to display and how. This part is the most useful and is really straightforward.

The last section of the control panel lets the user set up custom fields for data and run a test of the whole project, and outputs detailed error information.

Following the training page, http://dhpress.org/training/, it is possible to take advantage of a pre-existing database, which can be used to quickly set up a project, so that one can instantly work on the main control panel. There is a detailed google document that guides the user through the process step by step, and also offers an even more detailed annex. A couple of hours is enough to go through all of it and get the necessary information to use it correctly. Then, any view can be quickly set up and customised in any desired way.

Overall, this toolkit is quite stable, reliable, user-friendly after the first entry barrier and gives you a varied set of tools to visualise and display a large amount of data in a neat, organised manner.

Projects that work closely with documents---researching, contextualizing, and ordering them---invariably produce massive amounts of thorough research notes which are too often locked away in filing cabinets or the minds of editors and curators, never to be seen by anyone. The Editors' Notes project is a collaboration between the editors of the Stanton-Anthony Papers, the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Labadie Collection which aims to preserve those research notes in a way that makes them useful to future scholars and interested minds.

Research teams can use Editors' Notes to manage their research and note-taking. Project administrators can assign research tasks to other team members, and they can control who has permission to edit their project's notes.

Notes can be organized around documentary sources or thematically around topics (or both). Users can browse by topic, search full text, and filter using bibliographic metadata. Documents can be annotated with bibliographic metadata, topic keywords, and textual notations. Researchers can also upload scanned images of documents into the zoomable interface. Researchers can annotate specific passages in document transcripts. Annotations, like other notes, can include bibliographic metadata and topic keywords and are fully searchable. In addition to creating annotated transcripts, researchers can upload scanned images of documents, which can be viewed in a zoomable interface.

New accounts are by invitation only. Request an invitation. Editors' Notes is currently in limited beta release (Nov 10/14)

With ELAN a user can add an unlimited number of textual annotations to audio and/or video recordings. An annotation can be a sentence, word or gloss, a comment, translation or a description of any feature observed in the media. Annotations can be created on multiple layers, called tiers. Tiers can be hierarchically interconnected. An annotation can either be time-aligned to the media or it can refer to other existing annotations. The content of annotations consists of Unicode text and annotation documents are stored in an XML format (EAF).

Main features and characteristics of ELAN:
* provides several ways to view the annotations, each view is connected to and synchronized with the media timeline
* supports creation of multiple tiers and tier hierarchies
* supports Controlled Vocabularies
* allows linking of up to 4 video files with an annotation document
* media support
   * builds on existing, native media frameworks, like Windows Media Player, QuickTime or VLC
   * support for audio and video formats depends on operating system, high performance media playback can usually be achieved
* technical

The new ESS data and metadata service consists of multiple data and metadata repositories to support an efficient, collaborative, version-controlled data archive workflow. The service makes use of the Colectica software solutions for metadata management and the Azure cloud for data storage and management. The repositories are accessed via ESS API for management and dissemination of data and metadata.

The Colectica software solutions and cloud storage for data enables powerful data search, analysis, visualization and download services by adhering to the DDI Lifecycle Metadata Standard. The new ESS service has made ESS data more findable – for humans and machines.

The BBT is an overarching meta-thesaurus for humanities research data. It offers top-level-concepts (facets and hierarchies) that serve as the common ground for thesaurus building. It relies on a faceted classification, which is considered valid and consistent from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Among the major advantages of such a classification, is its potential expansion into new scientific domains in a sustainable and manageable fashion. It is important to underline that the BBT, explicitly does not require domain experts to abandon their terminology in the name of some universally accepted terminology. Rather, the core feature of the BBT is that it promotes alignment of cutting-edge terminology to well-formed general terms of the meta-thesaurus capturing general meanings. This enables collaboration and cross-disciplinary resource discovery, while ensuring compatibility with thesauri that cover highly specific and developing areas of knowledge. By design, not only can the BBT function as an overarching thesaurus for the humanities, to be used by a gradually growing community of thesauri maintainers, but it can also evolve into a distributed federated thesaurus, bringing together several specialist thesauri, under one common scheme.

It is a tool for culturomic exploration through the observation of chronological trends for words and phrases in large digitized collections of textual documents with metadata facets.



The world's great research libraries have, over time, carefully assembled a rich body of metadata pertaining to the books in their collections. Since the HTRC has access to volume-level metadata as well as volume-level content, we have constructed a Bookworm of the HathiTrust Non-Google-digitized public domain (NGPD) corpus. We felt that setting up Bookworm with a HathiTrust corpus would provides scholarly researchers with the means of exploring trends.



This tool enables scholars to discover new textual use patterns across the entire corpus. In the future, we plan to ingest the entire HathiTrust corpus and continue to identify appropriate metadata to use for the faceted browsing. This tool will be particularly useful to scholars interested in books that are still under copyright - which is the case for most books published after 1923. Although these books will not be available for reading or downloading online, working with individual words and phrases and tracking their occurrences through time will be useful to academic researchers, especially historians, sociologists and literary scholars.



John Unsworth has noted that a fundamental goal of the humanities is appreciation: \"by paying attention to an object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value\" (2004). Shifting from traditional close reading to a large-scale view of text presents a profound discomfort for humanities scholars, due to the difficulty in retaining the same sensitivity to what is actually contained in the works being studied. HTRC-Bookworm will function as a link between quantitative analysis (distant reading) and close reading. According to Frederick Gibbs and Daniel Cohen, \"any robust digital research methodology must allow the scholar to move easily between distant and close reading, between the bird's eye view and the ground level of the texts themselves\" (2011). This is what HTRC-Bookworm intends to accomplish (within the limitations of applicable copyright laws.)



Current limitations and future improvements:



The current instantiation (the alpha version) of the HTRC-Bookworm is set up to work with only 250,000 out-of-copyright volumes from the HathiTrust NGPD corpus. Overall the HathiTrust has more than 11,000,000 volumes in all their corpus, consisting of 420 billion pages.

BlackLab is not an end-user application, but an extension to Apache Lucene. It requires programming experience to use. Several sites have so far been built using BlackLab. The BlackLab FAQ at https://github.com/INL/BlackLab/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions lists several of these.

BlackLab is very useful as search engine for morphologically adorned corpora. The principal search language syntax is similar to that of traditional corpus search engine tools such as the Corpus Workbench or the Sketch Engine.

It also offers scientific social network functionalities. As such, it falls into the category of search engines and assistants and offers many features to organize scientific monitoring with :

- collect, classify and organize the documents found;
- gather all their scientific production in order to edit it in a personal profile page;
- follow the productions of colleagues;
- record and publish queries and their results for monitoring purposes;
- create bibliographies that can be exported to Zotero.

ISIDORE is part of the long tradition of open documentary tools made by the SSH for the identification of data sources, be they textual, audiovisual, serial or - since the massive arrival of digital data - complex and hybrid. The importance of citability and of guaranteeing access over time to documents, publications and research objects is particularly crucial in the digital medium, as the Web evolves every day and changes regularly. Multidisciplinary access and the need to reuse research data require powerful tools for data identification and description corresponding to the paradigms of SSH.","hn.isidore",NA,1,"Administrator","Administrator","enabled","2021-05-28T15:28:06+0000","administrator",TRUE,202,"EOSC Catalogue","https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/","https://providers.eosc-portal.eu/api/resource/{source-item-id}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The range of topics of the iSybislaw system includes Slavic linguistics, confrontative linguistics and Slavic–non-Slavic contrastive linguistics, as well as theoretical and general linguistics that are significant in the field of Slavic linguistics. The system directs to different types of documents, in which the relevant information for the users is contained: to non-serial publications (monographs, joint publications, dictionaries, etc.), serial publications (journals), and articles, reviews, etc.

The appropriate structuralisation of retrieval collection enables users to obtain necessary information easy and fast.

JuxtaposeJS is free, easy to use, and open source. Almost anyone can use JuxtaposeJS, so long as you've got links to two similar pieces of media (hosted on your own server or on Flickr). Once you've got the links, all you need to do is copy and paste the URLs into the appropriate fields at Juxtapose.knightlab.com, modify labels as you see fit, add photo credits, and then copy and paste the resulting embed code into your site.

You've probably seen similar photo slider tools elsewhere. They work well, but we built JuxtaposeJS without relying on jQuery, which makes the tool more lightweight, flexible, and adaptable. It's also accessible to any newsroom or journalist, regardless of technical skills.



It also offers some customization out of the box. You can modify the handle's start position to highlight the area of change and choose to click the slider instead of dragging. It is responsive and works on phones and tablets with the touch or swipe of a finger.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell, when reading RFC 1766 or RFC 3066 that these specifications have been obsoleted and replaced by other specifications.

The latest RFC describing language tag syntax is RFC 5646, Tags for the Identification of Languages, and it obsoletes the older RFCs 4646, 3066 and 1766.

To study such letter data on a global level, the heterogeneous, distributed data in local siloes need to be aggregated and harmonized into larger services where local metadata can enrich each other to complement missing information. LetterSampo a new framework for representing, publishing, and using epistolary data as Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web for Digital Humanities (DH) research. The framework issued for creating LOD services and for building individual LetterSampo portals on top of them. To test and demonstrate the framework, it has been applied to the epistolary CKCC dataset of ca. 20 000 letters of the Huygens Institute, the Netherlands, to the correspSearchdataset of ca.151 000 letters aggregated by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and to the Early ModernLetters Online (EMLO) data of ca.170 000letters published by the University of Oxford. The CKCC and correspSearch datasets were published as LOD services, SPARQL endpoints, and as data dumps at Zenodo.org for re-use, and a demonstrational portal LetterSampo: Historical Letters on the Semantic Web was created based on this data. A novelty of the LetterSampo portals is to use faceted semantic search for filtering data of interest in flexible ways from multiple perspectives on two conceptual levels, and then visualize and analyzethe results and data by seamlessly integrated data analytic tools - programming skills are not needed for using the portals. In addition to using the tools of the portal, the SPARQL endpoints can be used with modest knowledge about programming for DH research",NA,NA,65,"4ea88b26c3275dbb81ef7ec4f4c5869ce4c0e751268125e9361f0f36e542fb18@dariah.eu","Laure Barbot","enabled","2021-07-28T07:54:55+0000","moderator",FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since its construction around 2800 BC (Renfrew 1979: 203), the site has had a long history of re-use and disturbance (Davidson \& Henshall 1989: 61-2, 145). The presence of several runic inscriptions in the main chamber and the SE side-chamber indicates later Norse re-use, probably during the mid-12th century (Barnes 1994: 215). The ease with which these can be made out varies and some are now very difficult to see with the naked eye. Our work set out to examine how far Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) could reveal the sequence of overlapping carvings, in order to help recognise runes that are difficult to see with the naked eye or indeed with a camera and raking light flash.

Powerful built-in annotation and commenting systems allow readers to annotate, highlight, discuss, cite, and share passages from any Manifold text. Resources that are foundational to a particular discussion but that are often tabled because of physical, technical, logistic, or legal limitations can be layered dynamically and directly onto the digital text. And with Manifold, a new kind of publication is possible, one where authors create projects that grow iteratively and that are published online as they are created and then later in print, when they have been codified as versions of record. In short, Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works.

For the end user, the MMMPortal facilitates semantic faceted search and exploration of the data, integrated seamlessly with data analytic tools for solving research problems in manuscriptstudies. In addition, the SPARQL endpoint of the LOD service can be used with external tools for customized use in DH research and applications. The MMM Sampo services  are  available  online,  based  on  metadata  of  over 220 000 manuscriptsfrom the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts of the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (University of Pennsylvania), the Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford  Libraries,  and  Bibale  of  Institut  de  recherche  et  d’histoire  des  textesin  Paris.

NeMO is a CIDOC CRM - compliant ontology which explicitly addresses the interplay of factors of agency (actors and goals), process (activities and methods) and resources (information resources, tools, concepts) manifest in the scholarly process. It builds on the results of extensive empirical studies and modelling of scholarly practices performed by the Digital Curation Unit in projects DARIAH and EHRI.

NeMO incorporates existing relevant taxonomies of scholarly methods and tools, such as TaDIRAH, the arts-humanities.net and Oxford taxonomies of ICT methods, DHCommons, CCC-IULA-UPF and DiRT, through appropriate mappings of the concepts defined therein onto a semantic backbone of NeMO concepts. It thus enables combining documentary elements on scholarly practices of different perspectives and using different vocabularies.

The development of NeMO is an on-going project that greatly benefits from the discussions in related workshops and meetings and the generous intellectual contributions of participants. Interested individuals are invited to continue participating, and also to contribute comments through this site.",NA,"",207,"09da271bfff10ccaabbadcb52fca13fe7c75125b25e03adf8544aaa4635364f2@dariah.eu","Stefan Buddenbohm","enabled","2021-09-21T07:55:06+0000","moderator",FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"cf4be490-d063-43a9-a36a-7237951960ad","image","NeDiMAH-Logo.png","image/png",TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
