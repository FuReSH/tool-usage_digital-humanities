This little demo shows various locations in the first level of DOOM Episode 1 Map 1 (E1M1). Once players begin the level, they can see an armor bonus floating in a pool of toxic goo . This foreshadows the players ability to find the armor through a secret door later in the level . Players can wander to the left upon entering the level and find the first armor bonus in the game .
