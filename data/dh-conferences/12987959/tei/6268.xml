                    <anchor xml:id="oswfywlmaosr"></anchor>Description
                
                <p rend="normal">Computer-assisted text analysis is a core research area in the Digital Humanities. It embraces a wide variety of applications (stylometry, text reuse detection, topic modelling, etc.) and can assist researchers in complex tasks, particularly when it comes to processing large amounts of text. This tutorial brings together two popular and complementary text analysis tasks, stylometry (the quantitative study of writing style) and text reuse detection. While stylometry typically focuses on stylistic similarities between texts (i.e. 
                    <hi rend="italic">how</hi> texts are written), text reuse studies are geared towards the reuse of elements across works (i.e. 
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">what </hi>texts are written about). As such, both methodologies tie into the theoretical notion of 
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">intertextuality </hi>(Orr 2003), albeit in complementary ways
                    <hi rend="italic">.</hi>
                </p>
                <p rend="normal">Creativity and individuality are important phenomena at stake in both fields: are writers at liberty to escape their own ‘stylome’ - or unique stylistic fingerprint - and to which extent can they free themselves from the many predecessors to which they are intertextually indebted? (Harold Bloom (1973) famously spoke of the ‘Anxiety of Influence’ in this respect) This leads to interesting theoretical tensions: if authors are stylistically close to one another, does that imply that we can also expect a more elevated level of text reuse between them (and vice versa)? Or can authors frequently reuse textual elements while developing an independent stylistic profile? To which extent is it theoretically possible to oppose style and content?</p>
                <p rend="normal">In this workshop we offer a hands-on introduction to these topics using the case study of Rowling’s Harry Potter novels. The vast body of academic scholarship of these writings attests to the relevance of this series, including the highly mediatized stylometric study by Patrick Juola (2013) unmasking Rowling as “Robert Galbraith”, the pseudonym under which she temporarily managed to escape her own fame. Intertextuality is also a major concern of Rowling scholarship and scholars as Karin Westman (2007) have meticulously analyzed Rowling’s nuanced indebtedness to British authors such as Jane Austen. Rowling herself has invited much intertextual offspring by now too, not in the least in the form of so-called fanfiction (Milli &amp; Bamman 2016), the global phenomenon where (typically non-professional) writers read, reinterpret and expand literary universes (
                    <hi rend="italic">fandoms</hi>) originally created by acclaimed authors in their own writings (or 
                    <hi rend="italic">fanfics</hi>).
                </p>
                <p rend="normal">The workshop’s tutorial will focus on offering scholars the practical tools and skills to begin to tackle such complex issues. For text reuse detection, participants will learn how to operate TRACER, a language-independent suite of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms aimed at discovering text reuse in both historical and modern texts, helping users to identify different types of text reuse ranging from verbatim quotations to paraphrase. For the stylometric analyses and visualizations, participants will mainly use custom scripts that exploit the numerous possibilities of the popular Python library 
                    <hi rend="italic">scikit-learn</hi> for Machine Learning. Stylometry with R (Eder et al. 2016), a software package for text analysis in 
                    <hi rend="italic">R</hi>, is another tool that will be used in the introductory sessions.

                Data
                <p rend="normal">Participants will practise with data provided by the organizers to better familiarize themselves with the software. The texts under analysis will be the seven English language Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling (the so-called core canon of the fandom), a large corpus selection of Harry Potter fanfiction (harvested from 
                    <hi rend="italic">Archive of Our Own</hi>) as well as the Harry Potter movie subtitles.

                Objectives
                <p rend="normal">The first objective of the tutorial is to introduce participants to two popular applications of text analysis that tie in closely with intertextuality studies, providing them with an understanding of some of the challenges, methods and strategies proper to this area of research. To this end, we use the illustrative Rowling case study to identify which proportion of the original novels and how much of their style the movies and fanfiction both retain. Additionally, the tutorial seeks to equip participants with the necessary knowledge to independently use the demonstrated software at home (and on their own corpora). Finally, it introduces visualization techniques to display results in an intuitive fashion, provoking new hermeneutic questions.</p>
