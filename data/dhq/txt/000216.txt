Jamie Skye Biancoâ€™s Man and His Tool, Again? Queer and Feminist Notes on Practices in the Digital Humanities and Object Orientations Everywhere is an interactive HTML-based article. For convenience, we have also included a static PDF version of the article. As additional context, we include a response by Nicole Starosielski which situates the piece in a classroom and readership setting.
