# Abstract 


This tutorial addresses one of the central challenges of the digital humanities: the operationalization of theoretical concepts from the humanities for computer-based research. 

While humanities scholars primarily work with concepts that often encompass several textual phenomena and furthermore draw on contexts deemed relevant for their interpretation, computer-based work is bound to identifiable phenomena on the textual surface. The resulting discrepancy between theoretical expectations and concrete results needs to be bridged by an adequate operationalization. Thereby, the goal is to develop procedures to trace back theoretical concepts to text surface phenomena, potentially in several sub-steps. Or, in short: to detect and measure instantiations of theoretical concepts. 

With our tutorial, we want to focus on this practice and its theoretical backgrounds: On the basis of selected use cases, we will show which challenges arise from the use of computational methods for questions in the humanities and how they can be dealt with. In a practical part, the participants will have the opportunity to work on the operationalization of relevant concepts for exemplary text analyses. For this purpose, we provide Jupyter notebooks for the prepared use cases. Programming skills are not required. 

The aim of the tutorial is to raise awareness of the differences between established methods in the humanities and computer-based approaches, to address typical challenges, and to develop approaches for adequately operationalizing theoretical concepts from the humanities. We are convinced that reflecting the underlying assumptions of an operationalization is the only way to ensure that one can then handle the results appropriately. 


# Target Audience 


This tutorial targets all researchers with an interest in reflecting their understanding of operationalization theoretically and practically. Group size between 15 and 25 people would be preferable.
