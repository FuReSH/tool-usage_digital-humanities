"1","ADHO Annual Conference","ADHO","The ADHO organizes and sponsors an annual conference. The first joint conference was held in 1989 at the University of Toronto. That event was the 16th annual meeting of ALLC and the ninth annual meeting of the ACH-sponsored International Conference on Computers and the Humanities (ICCH). Since then, the joint conference has grown to include additional organizations, and it has been held in cities around the world."
"2","Association for Computers and the Humanities / International Conference on Computers and the Humanities","ACH/ICCH","The Association for Computers and the Humanities arose from the community that started the ""International Conference on Computing in the Humanities"" conference, or ICCH, in 1971. The ACH was officially founded in 1978, and continued organizing a biennial conference until 2005, after which it became simply the ""Digital Humanities"" conference under the ADHO umbrella. From 1989-2005, the ACH and ALLC co-branded each others' conferences. ACH renewed its biennial conference in 2019, while maintaining its affiliation with ADHO.

Until around 1990, ACH conferences were called ""ICCH"" conferences."
"3","Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing / European Association of Digital Humanities","ALLC/EADH","A series of conferences running from 1970-2006, mostly in Europe. The organization itself was formed in 1973, and the first conference so-titled was in 1974,  however two earlier conferences were held titled ""Symposium on the Uses of Computers in Literary Research"" that later formed the organization. In 1989, the ALLC and ACH began co-branding their conferences, alternating location and host each year. In 2006, the ACH/ALLC conference was renamed the DH conference, but that conference were still co-listed as an ACH/ALLC conference. Subsequent to 2006, it was simply ""DH"". The ALLC eventually renamed itself to the ""European Association of Digital Humanities,"" and in 2018 restarted its biennial conference in that name.

This series is not to be confused the the ALLC International Meetings / Annual General Meetings (1973-1983)."
"4","Joint Annual Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing","ACH/ALLC","The joint ACH/ALLC (or ALLC/ACH) conference series ran from 1989 to 2004, and was afterwards replaced by ADHO's ""DH"" conference. Its first two conferences were co-listings of ALLC and ACH's predecessor, ICCH (International Conference on Computing in the Humanities)."

"7","European Association of Digital Humanities Conference","EADH","The first conference of the ALLC was held in Cambridge, UK, in 1970 and annually thereafter until 1988, when a protocol was agreed with the Association for Computing in the Humanities for co-sponsorship of joint international conferences. The venue for these joint conferences alternated between Europe and North America. The first one took place in 1989 at the University of Toronto in Canada. 1997 marked a return to Canada, to Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. In 2005 the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations was formed and in 2006 the first joint conference under this new umbrella was held at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.

The first conference of the EADH was held at the National University of Ireland, Galway, 2018."
