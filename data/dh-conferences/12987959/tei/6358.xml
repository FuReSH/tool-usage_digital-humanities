            <p rend="Cuerpo">We are proposing to develop a storytelling tool that integrates multimodal mapping for use in language classrooms. Through a Digital Humanities approach on Storytelling Labs, we will be integrating the App StoryMapJS in order to create a storymap of their cultural heritages. This DH tool is very accessible and it will allow the student to engage mapping narrative through images, videos, music, writing and maps; so the heritage learners will interpret space by their personal print, and it will let to other readers from the course or outside the course, to confront other sociopolitical contexts.</p>
            <p rend="Cuerpo">The DH Storytelling Heritage Lab will reforge the spatial, and emotional relation from our heritage learners as individuals that can create their own mapping. In a pedagogical perspective the heritage learner will improve their writing, oral, listening and reading skills in Spanish. In a linguistic research approach we will analyze the outcome of the students, a qualitative discourse analysis. </p>
            <p rend="Cuerpo">The workshop will be divided in two sections: the narrative without the DH tool: the student will engaged their narratives through family albums, objects, drawings, and recordings. The second part is to transform the storytelling into a digital narrative with the StoryMapJS. At the end of the Lab the student will have the opportunity to exhibit their narratives maps. The final stories will be compiled in a single web page for their distribution in different areas.</p>
            <p rend="Cuerpo">The idea to expand the personal stories and experience in the US of the heritage learners is essential for the course; so the learners engaged Spanish in the sociopolitical context of bilingualism of their own families and community. Their narratives, our narratives, will enrich the course. </p>
