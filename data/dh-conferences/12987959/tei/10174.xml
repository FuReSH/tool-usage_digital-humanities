The Caribbean Region of the International Resource Network (Caribbean IRN) connects academic and community-based researchers, artists, and activists around the Caribbean and its diasporic communities in areas related to diverse sexualities and genders. The IRN is housed at CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies at the City University of New York, originally funded through the Ford Foundation and located on the web at www.irnweb.org. The Caribbean IRN uses digital technologies to share resources and forge connections across the region. We published our first online, open access, multi-media collection Theorizing Homophobias in the Caribbean: Complexities of Place, Desire and Belonging – at www.caribbeanhomophobias.org – in June 2012. This online multimedia collection of activist reports, creative writing, critical essays, film, interviews, music, and visual and performance art offered ways to define and reflect on the complexities of homophobias in the Caribbean, while also expanding awareness about Caribbean sexual minority lives, experiences, and activism in the region and its diaspora.
