800,"An Bunachar Náisiúnta Beathaisnéisí Gaeilge","For the purposes of review, I have chosen a tool called 'Ainm.ie'. It is an online database which consists of approximately 1700 biographies for individuals who have made a significant contribution to the Irish language over the past 5 centuries. My goal is to use it as a resource for my dissertation (\" 'Sun Tzu Is Ainm Dom': Ireland's Language and Its Military Diaspora\"). To that end, I have been searching Ainm.ie for figures connected to both the Irish language and military history. So far, I have searched for individuals based on the following criteria:1: Each candidate must have a connection to Irish military history (a field which is at times difficult to separate from overall military history).2: Definition of a connection: a person of Irish descent who has engaged in military service on behalf of a foreign power in an army, marine (in the case of Britain or the US), naval or air capacity.3: If an individual is related to a figure who has engaged in such activities, this is also acceptable.4: Also counted amongst my choices are individuals who have aided war efforts in civilian capacities, e.g. propaganda campaigns, recruitment  drives, diplomacy or intelligence work.5: They must also have made a positive contribution to the Irish language, or have used it to some extent during wartime.6: The (surprisingly large) number of people with no Irish connection but who have served in military conflicts will not be included for the purposes of this particular study.7: Those who may have served in the Irish army are not mentioned as I do not count them as part of the military diaspora.Based upon said qualifications, I have chosen 90 people (so far). In order to understand my choice of Ainm.ie as a research tool, it is first necessary to understand my reasons for choosing my research topic. I want (insofar as it's possible) to tell the story of Irish speakers at war, because it's something which I feel has been neglected. Because this is a very much a niche topic, it has proven impossible for me to rely solely on conventional digital tools. Simply typing the phrase 'Irish (or Gaelic) speakers in the British (or American/French/, etc.) army' into Google, Google Scholar or DuckDuckGo does not guarantee a result. It has even been necessary for much of the time to consult non-digital resources. Since my goal has been to create a digital artifact using any and all means at my disposal, I have had to content myself with a lack of digital tools at my disposal. Ainm.ie has, however, been an exception due to the sheer volume of information it contains. Here is a breakdown of how the site's functions relevant to my work:Search engineThis is the most basic function on the sight and it has the standard function of any website search engine. Beneath it, there is another search button for more specialized searches involving 'keywords' and 'phrases'. I have used this many times for military terms such as 'soldier(s)', 'war(s)', 'military', 'regiment(s)', 'brigade(s)', etc. The site is mostly in Irish. Changes in spelling and grammar are important when deciding what phrase to search for. Take for example if one searches for the phrase briogáid (the Irish for 'brigade' in the nominative case), the same results will usually be yielded if he/she uses bhriogáid (the dative case equivalent).Alphabetical listThis enables the user to search for individuals by the first letter of their surname. Highly useful, but a distinction must be made between \"Ó\" and \"O' \" at the start of some names, and also between names rendered wholly in Irish or English.ThemesSearches can be carried under the following headings: placenames, works, the Gaelic League, educational institutions, professions and political parties. In my view, this section has its drawbacks because the part dealing with placenames is limited insofar as one cannot search for South Africa, even though references are made to the Boer War. The 'professions' search is also problematic, because although one can find 'SMYTHE, William James' under the title 'soldier', because he is tagged as such in his entry's information box (see next entry), having spent a good deal of his life in the Royal Artillery. Ó FLAITHEARTA, Liam cannot be found under same, because even though he fought in the Irish Guards during the First World War, he is not tagged as a soldier. The reasons for such distinctions are not made clear. Ó Flaithearta left the army after the war. Ó CATHÁIN, Seán (1889–1948) was in the US army at the same time, and left the army after the war, but he is tagged with Smythe.Information boxEach individual biographical entry contains a box on the left-hand corner containing basic details such as place of birth, gender, school, higher education and writer. The place of birth section because it provides a link to 'logainm.ie', a website which provides information in both English and Irish regarding Irish placenames. Some entries also contain a profession section, where those with similar professions are usually tagged together, but with some exceptions (see previous entry)In spite of the few disadvantages outlined above, I have found 'Ainm.ie' to be the best digital for my subject matter so far. As it is my intention to create a digital artifact on the links between the Irish language and military history, it has been an invaluable aid for biographical details.","Q19950874","An Bunachar Náisiúnta Beathaisnéisí Gaeilge"

Water exactly isn't a friend when it causes persistent leaks or dampness in the walls and basement of your home. If you have, by any chance, experienced the horrible phase of soaked and wet basement then it is probably in your best interests that you get your basement waterproofed. As you never know, when is the next time you find yourself in the same situation again? But there are number of ways in which you can tackle this problem and hiring a professional contractor for basement waterproofing is one solution.The choice is yours- you can either hire professionals or seek professional advice such as the suggestions given below. Just find the ones which are most effective for your basement problems.What should you do when you first notice water in your basement? Start investigating outside the house. Your aim should be to find the manner in which water is making its way into your basement. Also make sure that the downspouts, gutters or any other drainage systems of your home are working effectively and doing its task of diverting the water away from your home. Keep the maintenance of your home in check- that's the key!With basement waterproofing, each situation is unique. Any good contractor will agree to the fact that one size doesn't fit all. Avoid systems that are not specifically designed for the situation you have- that is quite preventive against any problem to occur in near future. Your contractor must know what each problem of basement water id unique and requires different solutions. Most of them occur due to a majority of factors and that makes it all the more essential to invest in a good basement waterproofing system.The kind of basement waterproofing system you need to install depends upon your home's unique construction and situation including the kind of foundation system in place. It is also necessary that you know that many times just one repair isn't enough, you may have to go with a combination of approaches.It is one waterproofing method that many contractors do not recommend. According to them, a covering over a wall with leaks produces cosmetic solution if the source of leak isn't taken care of in time.This basement waterproofing technique is mostly suited for concrete foundations as seepage is through walls and not floors. The basic masonry elements like bricks, cinder block or stone aren't exactly what you would want. However water can be prevented from entering into the wall or basement by injecting a polyurethane or epoxy. However, many basement waterproofing companies call it a Band-Aid solution.This technique involves excavating down the foundation wall footer (6 to 8 ft.) and installing a French drain system or installing drainage tiles and hence correcting the drainage system.",NA,"Basement Waterproofing: Tips and Instructions"

731,"Canva \"The Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software\"","I would consider myself to be a visual learner.  I surround myself with gifs and memes, and when it comes to academia I gravitate towards infographics, mind-maps and charts to observe key pieces of information.  So it’s not surprising that I chose a graphics based tool to review.  In my area of study (Digital Humanities and IT), we cross paths with a myriad of visualisations every day, in many different formats.  I think then it is prudent that we should be able to create our own graphics in order to convey, share or focus our knowledge or opinions, even if we have a lower level of computer literacy.Enter “Canva.com”.  Canva has deemed itself the “Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software”, and it is definitely true to its word.  It is an open source software and its simplicity in my opinion is much needed.  I am familiar with Photoshop, Gimp, Photoplus and InDesign but as most of us know Photoshop et al, can be convoluted, time consuming and of course very expensive.  Canva was created in 2012 by Melanie Perkins of Sydney, Australia.  The idea for Canva stemmed from the fact that whilst teaching graphic design to her students, they struggled with the basics.  Perkins then formed a partnership with Cliff Obrecht and from there they initially created Fusion Books - an online design tool for designing high school yearbooks.  They later went on to launch Canva after realising that the technology they developed had even more potential. The website as mentioned previously, is www.canva.com.  Its interface, as it should be, is bright and simple, and very encouraging.  Canva may be used for designing posters, profile pictures, Facebook banners, infographics and pie/bar charts.  It revolves entirely around controls such as drag-and-drop, which makes adding, removing, and editing elements onto your canvas a cakewalk.  Canva stores a vast amount of text and images in its repository, the one slight snag is that you will have to pay $1 per image once your design is downloaded (which is still rather inexpensive).  Also, having said that, the software allows the user to upload many personal images for manipulation, so downloading the software’s images is not completely necessary.  When it comes to its colour scheme, at first glance Canva provides a palette of up to about 8 colours, but if you’re after a specific colour or hue then the colour-picker provided may help with that and it even allows you to enter a hexadecimal code for that specific hue.  There are also video tutorials available upon launching your account of how to work your way around the website.  Users can also create videos and gif images which can then be uploaded to social media accounts.  Your work can then be saved and exported to PDF and PNG depending on what it is you have created. If you are a design pro, then you may find Canva a bit limiting in what it has to offer.  Canva is very much aware of this, as it never had the intention of taking over pro tools such as the aforementioned Photoshop or InDesign.  With Canva the everyday user has everything to gain and nothing to lose by utilising it, but the professional has nothing to lose and not much else to gain.  Regardless of this, for the user who simply wants to make a flyer, poster, invitation or meme then Canva will be your best friend.  It helps the average user to overcome any design fears.  Canva employs designers and also reaches out to photographers and illustrators to share their works on the website for us to avail of.  It also provides creative inspiration via a stream of designs previously made by registered users, and this is why I feel it deserves recognition on DiRT.Since its origination in 2012, Canva has been growing from strength to strength, opening an office in Manila in 2014 and eventually raising additional funds of approx. 6 million dollars in 2015.  It also gained new investors that year, including Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson.  From reading reviews about Canva the outlook on the entire software looks positive.  It also seems to be escalating in rank on many tech based websites.  Canva has since created a workplace version of their software, which allows for team collaboration on various potential projects.  Smart Company gave Canva a gleaming review and listed it number 5 out of a total 75 in its article: “75 Best Tools for Skyrocketing Business Growth in 2016”.  If you have access to internet and a computer you’re basically more than half way there to designing your first masterpiece.

785,"DH Press","DH Press (originally called diPH) is a toolkit conceived as an easy-to-use WordPress plugin which allows potentially every kind of user to visualise and mashup historic and geographic information, documents and various types of multimedia content to develop digital humanities project.The user cannot start from the toolkit itself, as the first step to set up a project, when the toolkit is already installed, is a CSV import. This means that the raw information has to be processed first, through any software like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet, following some conventions dictated by the toolkit, and once completed must be exported in CSV format. The file can then be imported into DH Press.At this point, the user finally has full control over the data. First, the toolkit needs to be informed of what kind of data is in each column, as it can handle various types, such as Short Text, Long Text, Lat/Lon, Date, and Link. The steepest learning curve resides here, in the data management part, as the database must be set up very carefully, and fixing any problem later is complex. This does not mean that new users cannot approach the tool, but some basic research on data management is required to make correct use of it.After setting up all this fields, called “motes” in the toolkit, a legend can be assigned to each of them, for example a field called “city” might contain, through multiple entries, ten different cities, and to each of those will correspond the colour chosen by the user. It is also possible to assign icons or png images instead of colours.A single control panel then allows the user to create, set up and manage multiple visualisations of different kind, and in each of them the user can choose which information to display and how. This part is the most useful and is really straightforward.The last section of the control panel lets the user set up custom fields for data and run a test of the whole project, and outputs detailed error information.Following the training page, http://dhpress.org/training/, it is possible to take advantage of a pre-existing database, which can be used to quickly set up a project, so that one can instantly work on the main control panel. There is a detailed google document that guides the user through the process step by step, and also offers an even more detailed annex. A couple of hours is enough to go through all of it and get the necessary information to use it correctly. Then, any view can be quickly set up and customised in any desired way.Overall, this toolkit is quite stable, reliable, user-friendly after the first entry barrier and gives you a varied set of tools to visualise and display a large amount of data in a neat, organised manner.For a more detailed and personal review, please read http://claudiasartori.com/2015/01/tool-review-dh-press/",NA,"DH Press"

The Editors' Notes project is a collaboration between the editors of the Stanton-Anthony Papers, the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Labadie Collection which aims to preserve those research notes in a way that makes them useful to future scholars and interested minds.Research teams can use Editors' Notes to manage their research and note-taking. Project administrators can assign research tasks to other team members, and they can control who has permission to edit their project's notes. Notes can be organized around documentary sources or thematically around topics (or both). Users can browse by topic, search full text, and filter using bibliographic metadata. Documents can be annotated with bibliographic metadata, topic keywords, and textual notations. Researchers can also upload scanned images of documents into the zoomable interface. Researchers can annotate specific passages in document transcripts. Annotations, like other notes, can include bibliographic metadata and topic keywords and are fully searchable.

Developed since 2005, it has been in active use across many projects since 2009. It is available both as a free web service for researchers (hosted at the University of Sydney Data Centre) or for installation on a physical or virtual server (Open Source on gitHub). Researchers can design, create, manage, analyse, visualise and publish their own richly-structured database(s) through a simple web interface, without the need for programmer(s). Quite complex databases can be built in a few hours by borrowing structures and vocabularies published by other users. Databases can be designed and built incrementally, as existing data are not affected by changes in structure. Databases created by Heurist are stored in MySQL with a repeatable structure facilitating sustainability and independent access by other software. Advanced features include record linking, graph structure, drill-down facet searches, rule-based queries, custom reports, linked map-timelines, network visualisation, normalised spreadsheet import, crosstabulation, XML feeds, XSLT transforms. The team provides initial email and skype assistance for project setup at no cost, and special customisations at modest cost.Heurist is applicable in many domains including History, Archaeology, Anthropology, Cultural Research, Linguistics, Media Studies etc. It handles everything from text, tags and categories, through networks of rich relationships and offset annotations, to images, video, spatial data and dating (including non-western systems and dating uncertainty).Sophisticated searches (including faceted and rule-based) can be saved, organised and rendered as layered interactive maps, timelines, network visualisations, crosstabulations, lists, custom reports, XML and XSLT transforms, all of which can easily be printed or embedded (live) in a website - Heurist provides the html code required to embed results in a web page or CMS.Databases can easily be migrated later to a personal or institutional server. Since the data are stored in a standard MySQL database with a fixed and well-documented structure, the data can be accessed directly via SQL from most programming languages independently of Heurist.Version 4.2 (Jan 2016 onwards) is available as a service via the Heurist website.

840,"HT-Bookworm","Bookworm is a tool that visualizes language usage trends in repositories of digitized texts in a simple and powerful way. It is a tool for culturomic exploration through the observation of chronological trends for words and phrases in large digitized collections of textual documents with metadata facets.The world's great research libraries have, over time, carefully assembled a rich body of metadata pertaining to the books in their collections. Since the HTRC has access to volume-level metadata as well as volume-level content, we have constructed a Bookworm of the HathiTrust Non-Google-digitized public domain (NGPD) corpus. We felt that setting up Bookworm with a HathiTrust corpus would provides scholarly researchers with the means of exploring trends.This tool enables scholars to discover new textual use patterns across the entire corpus. In the future, we plan to ingest the entire HathiTrust corpus and continue to identify appropriate metadata to use for the faceted browsing. This tool will be particularly useful to scholars interested in books that are still under copyright - which is the case for most books published after 1923. Although these books will not be available for reading or downloading online, working with individual words and phrases and tracking their occurrences through time will be useful to academic researchers, especially historians, sociologists and literary scholars.John Unsworth has noted that a fundamental goal of the humanities is appreciation: \"by paying attention to an object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value\" (2004). Shifting from traditional close reading to a large-scale view of text presents a profound discomfort for humanities scholars, due to the difficulty in retaining the same sensitivity to what is actually contained in the works being studied. HTRC-Bookworm will function as a link between quantitative analysis (distant reading) and close reading. According to Frederick Gibbs and Daniel Cohen, \"any robust digital research methodology must allow the scholar to move easily between distant and close reading, between the bird's eye view and the ground level of the texts themselves\" (2011). This is what HTRC-Bookworm intends to accomplish (within the limitations of applicable copyright laws.)Current limitations and future improvements:The current instantiation (the alpha version) of the HTRC-Bookworm is set up to work with only 250,000 out-of-copyright volumes from the HathiTrust NGPD corpus. Overall the HathiTrust has more than 11,000,000 volumes in all their corpus, consisting of 420 billion pages.As a demonstration we have selected some metadata for use with this smaller corpus, but we are open to feedback on improvements to this metadata.Our plan is to ingest the larger HathiTrust corpus and to allow facets to be selected based on HTRC worksets.",NA,"HT-Bookworm"

877,"Ptolemaic","Ptolemaic is a computer application for music visualization and analysis written in the Java programming language. The software is designed to aid in the analysis of all types of Western music using established analytical techniques, including tonal functional analysis (Harrison 1994), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), hierarchical linear analysis (Schenker 1935, Jones 2002), tonal pitch-space analysis on the Tonnetz (Riemann 1915), pitch-class set analysis (Forte 1973), and transformation analysis (Lewin 1987). Musical works and excerpts may be opened and saved using the de-facto standard music notation interchange format, MusicXML. To assist in analysis, Ptolemaic can display the music on a pitch/time graph, on a pitch-class/time graph, on a step-class/time graph (also called a diatonic lattice) (Jones 2002), on the Tonnetz, or using filtered point-symmetry (Douthett 2008). Pitch classes and chords are color coded so that the user can easily correlate them across each graph. The benefit of having a software tool to visualize and perform certain analysis tasks is in automating processes that are normally time-consuming for the musician, thus allowing the music scholar to focus on the musical issues, rather than the technical issues of graphing, and calculating chord classes. Ptolemaic provides useful ways of visualizing a piece of music and tools for gaining more information about that music, so that the user can efficiently make informed musical decisions about the music and preserve that analysis for future study.",NA,"Ptolemaic"

Its modelling language has in-built functions that makes it easier to develop multi-scale and multi-paradigm models for environmental applications.

Two important innovations in TerraME are its use of anisotropic spaces and of hybrid automata models. Anisotropic spaces arise when modeling natural and human-related phenomena. For example, land settlers in a new area do not occupy all places at the same time. They follow roads and rivers, leading to an anisotropic pattern. Anisotropic spaces are implemented in TerraME using Generalized Proximity Matrices (GPM). The GPM is an extension of the usual definition of the spatial relations and include a combination of neighborhood measures in the absolute space and in the relative space.

A hybrid automaton is an abstract model for a system whose behavior has discrete and continuous parts. It extends the idea of finite automata to allow continuous change to take place between transitions. Adopting hybrid automata in spatial dynamical models allows complex models which include critical transitions.",NA,"TerraME"

Transformer was created to assist in the rescue of textual data from obsolete file formats such as DOS word-processor files. Sometimes, it proves impossible to rescue old data through normal means such as running the original application and exporting to a format which can be imported by a more modern program. Perhaps the program which created the data no longer exists or cannot be run on available hardware, or perhaps it cannot save to any format but its own. In these circumstances, it is often necessary to rescue the data by a process of manual conversion, identifying blocks of text or other data in the original file which can be replaced with Unicode characters, and building sequences of replacement operations which gradually convert the data. This often requires an exhaustive trial-and-error approach in which transformation operations are added incrementally and tested in various sequences before a reliable sequence is developed; then the sequence can be run on a group of files.
