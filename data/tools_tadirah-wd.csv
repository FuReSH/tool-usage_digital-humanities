Musical works and excerpts may be opened and saved using the de-facto standard music notation interchange format, MusicXML. To assist in analysis, Ptolemaic can display the music on a pitch/time graph, on a pitch-class/time graph, on a step-class/time graph (also called a diatonic lattice) (Jones 2002), on the Tonnetz, or using filtered point-symmetry (Douthett 2008). Pitch classes and chords are color coded so that the user can easily correlate them across each graph. The benefit of having a software tool to visualize and perform certain analysis tasks is in automating processes that are normally time-consuming for the musician, thus allowing the music scholar to focus on the musical issues, rather than the technical issues of graphing, and calculating chord classes.

It models network dynamics via Markov chain models; this approach is best applied to data where relations between actors and their behaviour can be treated as a state rather than as an event. Siena's statistical analysis processes can be time-consuming, as the system works via computer simulation of the network. It was in continuous development from 2001 through 2010, releasing versions up to 3.2. Development on Siena as a stand-alone program has concuded, and the project has shifted focus to RSiena, a version of Siena deployed in R." NA

TerraME provides an interface to TerraLib geographical database, allowing models direct access to geospatial data. Its modelling language has in-built functions that makes it easier to develop multi-scale and multi-paradigm models for environmental applications.

Two important innovations in TerraME are its use of anisotropic spaces and of hybrid automata models. Anisotropic spaces arise when modeling natural and human-related phenomena. For example, land settlers in a new area do not occupy all places at the same time. They follow roads and rivers, leading to an anisotropic pattern. Anisotropic spaces are implemented in TerraME using Generalized Proximity Matrices (GPM). The GPM is an extension of the usual definition of the spatial relations and include a combination of neighborhood measures in the absolute space and in the relative space.

A hybrid automaton is an abstract model for a system whose behavior has discrete and continuous parts. It extends the idea of finite automata to allow continuous change to take place between transitions. Adopting hybrid automata in spatial dynamical models allows complex models which include critical transitions." NA

For instance, it can analyze a novel and tell you the proportions of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, or of Afroasiatic origin. First-generation and second-generation language ancestor data is included, and the output is highly granular, allowing the scholar to see the origins of individual words, and statistics about each ancestor language.

This allows sophisticated use cases where different user groups with different rights are presented a completely different application working on the same database. In these cases development time ranges between 2 and 20 days.

A Topincs online database can be rented for a monthly fee. Topincs provide all services related to an online database: data modeling, programming, and support. They have special rates for educational institutions. Topincs can also be used as a Platform as a Service where the dark art of Topincs modeling and development must be studied online. The underlying semantic technology, Topic Maps, is taught there through hands on examples and will change your view on information technology." "Q7824882"

VAnnotatoR allows for segmenting and linking texts and images with other multimedia, multimodal data to ultimately create spatial hypertexts. It can be used to support concrete technical applications, e.g. the reconstruction of 3D scenes from texts as a preparatory step for the training of Text2Scene systems, or for applications in the digital humanities, such as the spatial reconstruction and linking of historical scenes or biographies with corresponding media content, such as images or 3D reconstructions of historical buildings. The entire system is interactively accessible with VR glasses in Virtual Reality (VR) and can be controlled and experienced accordingly. VAnnotatoR uses TextAnnotator as technological backbone and thus all its functions for annotation, task management, annotation evaluation as well as for collaborative and simultaneous processing of resources. Furthermore, VAnnotatoR uses TextImager to benefit from its NLP routines for automatic text analysis. VAnnotatoR is implemented on the basis of Unity3D and OpenVR and therefore runs with both systems and several VR glasses – it was tested on Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive and HTC Vive Cosmos under Windows 10.

A graphical modeling tool developed with CINCO is completely generated from an intuitive higher-level abstract specification language. Semantics-inducing parts of the tool that are difficult to define in an abstract declarative way (such as model interpreters, transformations, or code generators) are written in Java against a simple model-based API. CINCO handles the inclusion of the right buttons in the GUI that trigger those actions.

Furthermore, CINCO supports the integration of the Java Application Building Center (jABC) into the development process, so that even people with little or no programming experience can express model behavior in a process-oriented fashion." NA

ContaWords can also take into account that a sequence of words can, for example, be the name of an organization, a person or an entity (Named Entity Recognition).

This means that the raw information has to be processed first, through any software like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet, following some conventions dictated by the toolkit, and once completed must be exported in CSV format. The file can then be imported into DH Press.At this point, the user finally has full control over the data. First, the toolkit needs to be informed of what kind of data is in each column, as it can handle various types, such as Short Text, Long Text, Lat/Lon, Date, and Link. The steepest learning curve resides here, in the data management part, as the database must be set up very carefully, and fixing any problem later is complex. This does not mean that new users cannot approach the tool, but some basic research on data management is required to make correct use of it.After setting up all this fields, called “motes” in the toolkit, a legend can be assigned to each of them, for example a field called “city” might contain, through multiple entries, ten different cities, and to each of those will correspond the colour chosen by the user. It is also possible to assign icons or png images instead of colours.A single control panel then allows the user to create, set up and manage multiple visualisations of different kind, and in each of them the user can choose which information to display and how. This part is the most useful and is really straightforward.The last section of the control panel lets the user set up custom fields for data and run a test of the whole project, and outputs detailed error information.Following the training page, http://dhpress.org/training/, it is possible to take advantage of a pre-existing database, which can be used to quickly set up a project, so that one can instantly work on the main control panel. There is a detailed google document that guides the user through the process step by step, and also offers an even more detailed annex. A couple of hours is enough to go through all of it and get the necessary information to use it correctly. Then, any view can be quickly set up and customised in any desired way.Overall, this toolkit is quite stable, reliable, user-friendly after the first entry barrier and gives you a varied set of tools to visualise and display a large amount of data in a neat, organised manner.For a more detailed and personal review, please read http://claudiasartori.com/2015/01/tool-review-dh-press/" NA

The Editors' Notes project is a collaboration between the editors of the Stanton-Anthony Papers, the Emma Goldman Papers, the Margaret Sanger Papers, and the Labadie Collection which aims to preserve those research notes in a way that makes them useful to future scholars and interested minds.Research teams can use Editors' Notes to manage their research and note-taking. Project administrators can assign research tasks to other team members, and they can control who has permission to edit their project's notes. Notes can be organized around documentary sources or thematically around topics (or both). Users can browse by topic, search full text, and filter using bibliographic metadata. Documents can be annotated with bibliographic metadata, topic keywords, and textual notations. Researchers can also upload scanned images of documents into the zoomable interface. Researchers can annotate specific passages in document transcripts. Annotations, like other notes, can include bibliographic metadata and topic keywords and are fully searchable.

It is a tool for culturomic exploration through the observation of chronological trends for words and phrases in large digitized collections of textual documents with metadata facets.The world's great research libraries have, over time, carefully assembled a rich body of metadata pertaining to the books in their collections. Since the HTRC has access to volume-level metadata as well as volume-level content, we have constructed a Bookworm of the HathiTrust Non-Google-digitized public domain (NGPD) corpus. We felt that setting up Bookworm with a HathiTrust corpus would provides scholarly researchers with the means of exploring trends.This tool enables scholars to discover new textual use patterns across the entire corpus. In the future, we plan to ingest the entire HathiTrust corpus and continue to identify appropriate metadata to use for the faceted browsing. This tool will be particularly useful to scholars interested in books that are still under copyright - which is the case for most books published after 1923. Although these books will not be available for reading or downloading online, working with individual words and phrases and tracking their occurrences through time will be useful to academic researchers, especially historians, sociologists and literary scholars.John Unsworth has noted that a fundamental goal of the humanities is appreciation: \"by paying attention to an object of interest, we can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its value\" (2004). Shifting from traditional close reading to a large-scale view of text presents a profound discomfort for humanities scholars, due to the difficulty in retaining the same sensitivity to what is actually contained in the works being studied. HTRC-Bookworm will function as a link between quantitative analysis (distant reading) and close reading. According to Frederick Gibbs and Daniel Cohen, \"any robust digital research methodology must allow the scholar to move easily between distant and close reading, between the bird's eye view and the ground level of the texts themselves\" (2011). This is what HTRC-Bookworm intends to accomplish (within the limitations of applicable copyright laws.)Current limitations and future improvements:The current instantiation (the alpha version) of the HTRC-Bookworm is set up to work with only 250,000 out-of-copyright volumes from the HathiTrust NGPD corpus. Overall the HathiTrust has more than 11,000,000 volumes in all their corpus, consisting of 420 billion pages.As a demonstration we have selected some metadata for use with this smaller corpus, but we are open to feedback on improvements to this metadata.Our plan is to ingest the larger HathiTrust corpus and to allow facets to be selected based on HTRC worksets."
