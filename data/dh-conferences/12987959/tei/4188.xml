Introduction
Although the majority of Digital Humanities scholars still focus on textual analysis, we see an increasing number of studies using digitised visual sources and taking the first steps in the field of ‘Visual Big Data' (Ordelman et al, 2014). Scholars have increasingly used both large-scale digitised visual datasets as well as computational methods to analyse these datasets in new ways, see for example the work of Lev Manovich on Manga comics (2012), Time covers, and selfies (Ma-novich & Tifentale 2015) or the recent work of Le-nardo et al (2016) on visual pattern discovery in large databases of paintings as presented at the DH 2016 conference. Others focus on the identification of finding recurring images in visual collections. Terras & Kirton (2013) analyse the reuse of digital images of cultural and heritage material on the internet while Resig (2014) and Reside (2015) follow a similar approach using a closed dataset.

A similar trend can be observed at the ADHO Digital Humanities Conferences. In 2014 the special Interest group Audiovisual Materials in Digital Humanities was founded and at the 2015 and 2016 conferences, several papers were presented using (audio) visual sources (see e.g. Kleppe 2015, Lenardo et al. 2016, Lincoln 2016). Based on an analysis of the submissions for the 2017 conference, Scott Weingart observes that an increasing number of papers are based on research concerning non-textual sources (Weingart 2017). The use of non-textual sources challenges established research practices of Digital Humanities, leading to new research questions and the need for transformation of existing approaches, and the development of new methodologies. For example, how can we analyse the characteristics of images in large visual datasets? Some of these questions have also been raised in the analogue era. See, for example, the work of Barry Salt (1974) on the characteristics of opening shots of twentieth-century films, Scott McCloud (1994) on the visual language of Japanese manga and comics, or Peter Burke's take on using visual materials as historical evidence (2001).

Due to the digital turn, we now see the application of new techniques to answer similar and new types of research questions. One of the dominant techniques to analyse large-scale visual datasets is computer vision: a field that deals with how computers can generate a high-level of understanding of visual material (Smeulders 2000).This field has been seeing unprecedented improvements as part of the “Deep Learning Revolution” since the first deep Convolutional Neural Network (Krizhevsky 2012), unleashing new possibilities. This workshop will focus on how computer vision can be applied within the realm of Audiovisual Materials in Digital Humanities. During the workshop, attendees will both present (ongoing) work on applying computer vision and experiment with computer vision in their own work in a hands-on session. Possible questions include:

• What are state-of-art techniques in computer vision?

• What are possibilities and challenges in the application of computer vision in Digital Humanities research?

• How can non-expert researchers employ computer vision?

• How can cooperation between Humanities researchers and computer vision experts be improved so both can benefit of each other's expertise?

Workshop outline
The workshop will consist of four pillars:

•    A keynote by Lindsay King (Associate Director for Access and Research Services Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library, Yale University)

& Peter Leonard (Director Digital Humanities Lab, Yale University Library) & on “Processing Pixels: Towards Visual Culture Computation”

•    Paper presentations with results and ongoing work on applying computer vision in DH research projects. Papers will be selected by a review commission. All details on the Call for Abstracts can be found at the workshop website.

•    A hands-on session in which participants will be able to experiment with open source Computer Vision tools. This session will be led by Benoit Seguin of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, (EPFL). Benoit Seguin is a PhD Student in Computer Science from the DHLAB at EPFL. His work focuses on automatic patterns detection across icon-ographic collections. Before starting his PhD, he worked with microscope images for biomedical applications or electronic manufacturing problems.

•    Lightning Talks allowing participants to share their ideas, projects or ongoing work in a short presentation of two minutes. Interested researchers who want to present work will be able to submit their idea in a later stage.

SIG Endorsement
This workshop proposal is endorsed by the steering committee of the Special Interest Group Audiovisual Materials in the Digital Humanities (AVinDH). This will be the third workshop that will be organised by the SIG. The first workshop on audiovisual material in digital humanities took place at the 2014 DH Conference in Lausanne. This workshop paved the way for the foundation of the AVinDH Special Interest Group that was officially launched during the DH2015 Conference in Sydney. The second workshop took place during the DH2016 Conference in Cracow and dealt with audiovisual material and dedicated analysis tools in DH.

While the previous SIG-endorsed workshops were organised by the SIG's steering committee, this proposal on Computer Vision in Digital Humanities is mainly organised by members of the SIG and one representative of the Steering Committee. The steering committee applauds the initiative of the organisers since the theme of the workshop fits perfect in both

the SIG's aims as well as the current interest in nontextual sources as observed by Scott Weingart in his first analyses of the DH2017 submissions. Furthermore, the steering committee is enthusiastic about providing a platform for members of the SIG and the complete DH community to present high-quality work that will be selected by a review committee as well as ongoing work that will be presented in lighting talks. Both formats will contribute to the community and network building function that the SIG AVinDH promotes.

Programme Committee
The programme committee (PC) for this workshop consists of the workshop proposers (see list with names and bios below). For the paper selection process, the PC will be extended with at least 10 experts. The selection process will be chaired by Prof. Fran-ciska de Jong, Utrecht University/CLARIN ERIC and chair of the SIG's Steering Committee (f.m.g.dejong@uu.nl)

Composition of the Programme Committee (workshop proposers only)
