1. INTRODUCTION: TESSERAE AND THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF TEXT REUSE 


The detection and interpretation of allusion currently represent the dominant mode of study of Latin poetry. [^See, for example, , , and for points of entry to the study of intertextuality in Latin literature. ]The typical goal of intertextual study is to describe how links between texts affect the meaning of both the specific passages that contain them and the poems as a whole. Although intertextual associations may be signalled in many different ways (including similarity of action, character, or theme), verbal repetition, or text reuse, is the best studied and often the strongest type of signal. Philogical commentaries, copiously detailed collections of information on individual books of Latin epic poems, have been the traditional means for Latin poetry scholars to collect and present interpretations based on studies of text reuse. An example from Parkes’ recent commentary on the fourth book of Statius’ Thebaid demonstrates the practice of translating the evidence of verbal repetition into interpretation: "[Statius, Thebaid 4.260] audaci Martis percussus amore [ "struck by a bold desire for warfare "[^All translations are by the authors. ]]: … The collocation percussus amore [ "struck by a desire "] is not uncommon (compare e.g. Verg. G. 2.476, Hor. Epod. 11.2 amore percussum , and Nem. Cyn. 99) but Statius may be specifically recalling the ephebe Euryalus’ reaction to Nisus’ planned expedition at Verg. A. 9.197: magno laudum percussus amore [ "struck by a great desire for glory "]…. Like Parthenopaeus, Euryalus is eager to brave danger for the chance of glory ( A. 9.205–6), with similarly fatal results. "This exemplary note builds its interpretation on the evidence of the repetition of two key lexemes, the verb percutio ( "I strike ") and the noun amor ( "desire "). [^Because Latin is a highly inflected language, the same lexeme may occur in many different inflected forms. For example, percutio may appear as percussus ( "struck "), percutimus ( "we strike "), percusserant ( "they had struck "), etc. Traditional literary interpretation may privilege specific morphological forms, such as the opening words of Vergil’s Aeneid ( arma uirumque ), which are frequently adapted by later poets, but more often the various inflected forms of a lexeme may be considered to be the same. Tesserae converts all inflected forms to a single lemma (e.g., percussus and percussum are treated as percutio ) and so does not permit analysis of individual inflected forms. ]The cooccurence of these lexemes in the Statian passage signifies for most readers a link to the passage from Vergil. The discovery of such verbal links has been facilitated in recent years by digital tools such as the freely available Tesserae web interface ( tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu ), a search program developed by Neil Coffee and a team at the University at Buffalo. Tesserae allows users to search pairs of texts (an earlier source text paired with a later target text) in a corpus of over 300 poetic and prose works, in order to discover every instance where short passages (either lines of verse or grammatical periods) share two or more repeated lexemes. Thus, a Tesserae search that pairs the Thebaid with the Aeneid permits the user to discover the allusion discussed by Parkes by identifying the repetition of the lexemes percutio and amor . The Tesserae scoring system signals the potential interpretive significance of the match by assigning it a high score, 8 out of approximately 11. [^See section 2.b for discussion of the scoring system. ]

In addition, Tesserae identifies a second potential match (score = 7) between Thebaid 4.260 and another passage from the Aeneid : "Statius, Thebaid 4.260 prosilit audaci Martis percussus amore ( "Parthenopaeus leapt up, struck by a bold desire for warfare "). ""Vergil, Aeneid 7.550 accendamque animos insani Martis amore ( "I’ll inflame their minds with a desire for mad warfare "). "

The words in the Aeneid are spoken by Allecto, a demon of the underworld, and we may thus once more translate this evidence of verbal repetition provided by Tesserae into literary interpretation. [^Recent commentaries (such as , , and ) note the verbal parallel with Aeneid 7.550, but do not offer a literary interpretation of the link. Their reticence is symptomatic of the scholarly tendency to privilege certain allusions (here, Aeneid 9.197) over others in interpretation. The impartial automatic searches of Tesserae encourage an interpretive style that is both less hierarchical and less committed to authorial intention. ]Parthenopaeus’ desire to fight in the Theban war in Statius is not only fatal, like the desire of Vergil’s Euryalus to participate in Nisus’ expedition; it is also infernal, like the war provoked by Vergil’s Allecto. This is consistent with Statius’ characterization of the Theban war as destructive and impious throughout the Thebaid . Such new avenues for specific intertextual interpretation are the typical results of Tesserae searches. Previous examples of comparable results can be found in a study of verbal reuse of Vergil’s Aeneid by the epic poet Lucan . Coffee et al. hand-ranked all Tesserae results from a comparison of Lucan Bellum Civile 1 (target) and Vergil’s Aeneid (source) on a 5–point scale of interpretive significance. They concluded that the Tesserae search had identified 25% more interpretively significant instances of text reuse than the standard philological commentaries on Bellum Civile 1 . 

The interpretation of specific allusions relies partly on the characterization of the overall intertextual relationship between texts, which is often hampered by a haphazard approach to gathering data. This paper presents a more consistent, quantitative picture of the interactions between poets in the Latin hexameter tradition. We use Tesserae to generate a statistical analysis of relative rates of text reuse in 24 Latin hexameter works written from the 1 st century BCE to the 6 th century CE. We then compare the quantitative information about text reuse provided by Tesserae to the scholarly tradition of qualitative discussion of allusion by Latinists. Statistical analyses of certain aspects of Latin poetry are not new. Drobisch’s studies beginning the 1860s represented the birth of the modern statistical studies of metrical aspects of the epic hexameter, a tradition which has reached a high-water mark in the recent work of Ceccarelli . Counts of individual lexical items in Latin poetry, usually in an effort to determine whether particular words should be considered poetic or unpoetic , are best represented by the tradition of Axelson’s work . Yet scholars have not typically evaluated instances of verbal reuse in quantitative terms, as it has simply not been possible for human readers to count such instances accurately. The speed, consistency, and comprehensiveness of Tesserae searches now enable the interpreter to quantify the reuse of phrases on a scale beyond the capacities of ordinary human reading. 

Powerful and productive as the Tesserae interface is, the following limitations must be clearly understood. They bear on analysis of specific passages, and to a lesser extent on our large-scale study: 


- Text reuse does not give the full, complex picture of intertextuality in Latin hexameter, where allusions may be signalled by similarity of action, character, theme, and so on. 
- Not all text reuse features the repetition of two or more lexemes. At its current stage of development, Tesserae focuses on pairs of lexemes and so cannot reliably identify repetition of single significant words. It would accordingly be unable to flag, for example, the very common word arma ( "warfare "). This word takes on a new intertextual significance in poems written after the Aeneid , a foundational epic poem that begins with the words Arma uirumque cano… ( "I sing of arms and the man… ") . There is accordingly need of a sensitive human interpreter to uncover the metapoetic significance, for example, of the opening word of Ovid’s Amores, Arma graui numero uiolentaque bella parabam / edere… ( "I was beginning to sing of arms and violent wars in a serious meter... ") 
- The Latin poets wrote for an audience of Roman elites that were literate in Greek , and so created numerous translingual calques on Greek phrases. To remain with the example of Vergil, the Aeneid adapts numerous lines and phrases from Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey . Some foundational studies have uncovered these calques using traditional philological methods , but such studies have not been pursued systematically across the Latin corpus. A feature of Tesserae currently in development searches for such translingual allusions between Latin and Greek poetry, but is not yet a reliable tool. 
- Repetitions with verbal variations that seem slight to a human reader are determinative for Tesserae . For example, Tesserae will locate the following correspondence based on the repetition of the lexemes Acheron and moueo : "Silius Italicus, Punica 2.536 quis Acheronta moues , flammam immanesque chelydros… ( "[The weapons] with which you rouse the underword — flame and monstrous serpents… "). ""Vergil, Aeneid 7.312 flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta mouebo ( "If I cannot sway the gods above, I will rouse the underworld "). "But Tesserae cannot yet locate the equally significant allusion: "Silius Italicus, Punica 2.367 …aeternum famulam liberque Acheronta uidebo ( "…An eternal slave; I will see the underworld as a free man "). "The change from the verb moueo ( "I move ") to uideo ( "I see ") means the phrase no longer contains two repeated lexemes. This means that Tesserae will inevitably miss some of the variations on a verbal motif that form a component of the Latin poets’ creative art. That said, the majority of allusions identified via traditional reading are repeated phrases. So though Tesserae cannot uncover allusions of this type, the majority of such allusions are typically missed by human readers as well. 
- The Tesserae scoring system provides a measure of interpretive significance that correlates with human-generated measures . Numerous passages of Latin poetry that human readers have traditionally thought of as linked through allusion are also high-scoring lexeme matches, and these correspondences form the basis for scholarly confidence in the scoring system. Yet the score assigned to any given lexeme match does not generate by itself the kind of sensitive assessment of significance that a scholarly reader of Latin poetry brings to the identification of parallel passages. In order to be significant, the allusion must be placed in a larger scholarly narrative of the passage’s compositional goals. A human reader must be able to make a plausible interpretation of the allusion before it can be recognized as an allusion rather a chance repetition . Tesserae ’s usefulness comes in discovering potential allusive connections through lexeme matching and ordering them by the rarity and proximity of the paired lexemes. Subjective interpretation of these connections is still required for any meaning-making exercise . 


Within these acknowledged limitations, Tesserae can be an extraordinarily powerful tool for representing the large-scale reuse of text in a literary tradition. Focusing as it does on repetition of phrases, the most commonly studied marker of allusion, Tesserae can provide a large-scale view of intertextual relationships that models traditional scholarly practice. The program can generate provisional answers to questions of particular relevance to the study of the Latin hexameter genre. Tesserae enables us to undertake the first large-scale statistical study of intertextuality in classical literary studies. Classicists have used new digital tools since their inception, and several techniques of digital text analysis were pioneered on Latin literary corpora, from Fr. Busa’s Index Thomisticus to the Packard concordance of Livy . Studies of intertextuality, however, have generally been confined to pairs or very small sets of texts, and have traditionally relied on broad but subjective classification of intertextual data (synonyms, similar motifs, images, etc.), rather than objective parameters such as lexeme matches, lexeme frequency, and lexeme proximity. The Tesserae scoring system, however, represents the first opportunity to quantify the study of intertextuality using a large set of poems and objective parameters. Our object of study is the entire super-genre of Latin hexameter poetry, in which we privilege the system of relationships between texts rather than any integral text itself. 

Latin poetry scholars have traditionally divided the super-genre of hexameter into several subgenres, including satire, epic, and didactic . Is it possible to quantify the verbal cohesiveness and distinctiveness of these genres? What other general factors affect text reuse across the entire hexameter tradition? Can the well-known influence of Vergil and Ovid on their epic successors be quantified? In particular, can it be determined how frequently one predecessor’s text is reused compared to another’s? For example, is Statius’ Thebaid more Vergilian in terms of text reuse than another contemporary epic poem, Silius Italicus’ Punica ? Most specialist readers of these Flavian epic poets would correctly guess that the answer is no, but would perhaps not be so confident in making assertions about the two poems’ relative rates of reuse of other, earlier poets such as Ovid, Lucan, or Manilius. Which works in the classical hexameter tradition provide the most significant verbal resources for the hexameter epics of late antiquity? This study offers preliminary answers to such questions from a quantitative perspective by surveying the relative rates of text reuse in 24 Latin hexameter works written from the 1 st century BCE to the 6 th century CE. 


# 2. METHODS 



## a. Text Selection 


Our analysis included every possible source–target pair from a set of 24 Latin hexameter texts written from the 1 st century BCE to the 6 th century CE ( Table 1 [^The dates of texts mostly follow those found in Brill’s New Pauly , and depart in some cases from the dates used by the Tesserae to assign source and target text status for each pair ( http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/blog/authors−and−text−dates/ ). Where necessary, we manually corrected for the switched source and target. Some dates are uncertain; see, e.g., on Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica , or on Claudian’s De Raptu Proserpinae . Alternative datings would affect our results in some cases, since the calculation of the variable c exp depends on which text in a pair is considered the source and which the target. But the overall effect of any plausible change in dating would be small. ]). This set included every hexameter text available on the Tesserae website, [^The Tesserae repository is extensive but not complete. Relevant hexameter texts unavailable for the study at this writing include, for example, Ennius’ Annales , the Appendix Vergiliana , the Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus, and the various Latin versions of Aratus’ Phaenomena . ]excluding hexameter poems from polymetric collections (such as Catullus’ poems or Statius’ Silvae ), hexameter works with non-hexameter prefaces (such as Claudian’s In Rufinum [^We included Claudian’s De Raptu Proserpinae because it is an important text and because its pentameter preface is short compared to the text as a whole (69 out of 6991 words), and therefore unlikely to noticeably affect our results. ]), and four very short minor texts. [^Ausonius’ Precationes , Ordo Urbium Nobilium , and Cento Nuptialis (see section 3.c.iv), and Claudian’s In Consulatum Olybrii et Probini . ]


## b. Data collection and scoring 


Using the Tesserae Batch Processing option ( http://tess-dev.caset.buffalo.edu/html/batch.php ), we recorded the number of hits (phrases sharing at least two matching lexemes) in each source–target pair (searches conducted on 2 May 2014). Hits may include exact matches of inflected forms, such as Vergil, Georgics 1.493 exesa inueniet scabra robigine pila ~ Statius, Thebaid 3.582 tunc fessa putri robigine pila (lemmata: robigo , pilum ). Matches may also occur among differently inflected forms of the same lexeme, such as Vergil, Georgics 2.64 solido Paphiae de robore myrtus ~ Statius, Thebaid 4.300 hi Paphias myrtos a stirpe recuruant (lexemes: Paphius , myrtus ). [^False lemma matches also sometimes occur, such as Vergil, Georgics 4.308 ossibus umor ~ Statius, Thebaid 4.698 ora … umor . Here ossibus ( "bones ") and ora ( "faces ") are inflected forms of two different lexemes, both of which share the lemma os . Since such false matches occur infrequently, we did not expect them to affect the results significantly. ]

We used a set of search parameters that capture the most instances of interpretively significant text reuse while excluding many instances of less significant reuse. These were: 

- phrases as the search unit 
- lemma as the matching feature 
- 20 stop words, determined by frequency in the Tesserae corpus 
- scores calculated by stem 
- a maximum distance of 10, calculated by frequency 
- no score cutoff [^These parameters are explained at http://tess−dev.caset.buffalo.edu/html/help_advanced.php . ]

We then partitioned the results by score. Tesserae assigns each matched phrase a score (rounded to the nearest integer) according to the following formula, which reflects the observation that instances of text reuse featuring rare words in close proximity are often more interpretively significant than instances featuring common words spaced farther apart . 

- \(Score = \ln\left( \frac{\sum_{}^{}{\frac{1}{f(t)} + \sum_{}^{}\frac{1}{f(s)}}}{d_{t} + d_{s}} \right)\) 
- f(t) is the frequency of each matching term in the target text 
- f(s) is the frequency of each matching term in the source text 
- d t is the distances in the target text 
- d s is the distances in the source text 



Examples of hits of different scores are listed in Table 2 . 


## c. Weighing of counts 


We thus obtained for each pair a count of the number of hits at each score (from 2 to 11). Hits scoring 6 and lower were excluded from the analysis, since it has been shown that these are unlikely to be instances of interpretively significant text reuse . We were left with five data points for each pair, C 7 , C 8 , C 9 , C 10 , and C 11 (counts of score 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11; Table 8 and 9 ). In order to convert these five counts into a single useful composite count , C , we took advantage of the strongly linear relationships between counts of every score except for the rare C 11 hits. Because the mean correlation was strongest between C 9 and the other counts (mean R 2 = 0.879; mean ρ = 0.931), the smallest amount of error was introduced by converting all counts into C 9 , using a combination of linear regressions and principal component analysis. 

First, we used a series of linear regressions to characterize the relationship between C 9 and the other four counts and obtain an initial composite count, C regr . [^The regressions yielded the following formulae: 

- \(C_{9} = - 21.191 + 0.057C_{7}\) 
- \(C_{9} = - 17.943 + 0.225C_{8}\) 
- \(C_{9} = 36.958 + 6.168C_{10}\) 
- \(C_{9} = 84.259 + 212.062C_{11}\) 

We omitted the intercepts, which provide no useful information, and thus obtained a formula for a composite count: \(C_{regr} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.168C_{10} + 212.062C_{11}\) ]Second, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the five counts, first correcting for their very different scales by dividing each count by its standard deviation, in order to obtain a second composite count, C pca . [^The first principal component had weights \(0.458{\widetilde{C}}_{7} + 0.462{\widetilde{C}}_{8} + 0.465{\widetilde{C}}_{9} + 0.463{\widetilde{C}}_{10} + 0.383{\widetilde{C}}_{11}\) This led to, in original scale, the composite count (which accounts for 90.1% of the total variability): $$C_{pca} = 0.458\frac{C_{7}}{4341} + 0.462\frac{C_{8}}{1118} + 0.465\frac{C_{9}}{253} + 0.463\frac{C_{10}}{39} + 0.383\frac{C_{11}}{1} = 10^{- 3}\left( 0.106C_{7} + 0.413C_{8} + 1.839C_{9} + 11.775C_{10} + 447.617C_{11} \right)$$ Further rescaling it such that the weight for C9 became 1, we obtained: \(C_{pca} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.404C_{10} + 243.426C_{11}\) ]Noting the similar weights in the formulae for C regr and C pca , we chose the average weights for the final formula for composite counts, which we considered to be the “observed count”, C obs : 

- \(C_{regr} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.168C_{10} + 212.062C_{11}\) 
- \(C_{pca} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.404C_{10} + 243.426C_{11}\) 
- \(C_{obs} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.286C_{10} + 227.744C_{11}\) 




## d. Relative intensity of reuse 


The resulting observed counts could not be directly compared to one another, since the total lengths of the texts were different for each source–target pair. For instance, we expected to obtain a much higher C obs value for the pair Ovid, Metamorphoses (78098 words) – Silius Italicus, Punica (76292 words) than for the pair Horace, Ars Poetica (3090 words) – Claudian, De Bello Gildonico (3165 words), simply because there is much more space for text reuse in the longer texts. Indeed, we found that C obs was correlated with the lengths of both source and target texts, W s and W t ; the correlations were strongly linear when the variables were converted to a logarithmic scale ( c obs , w s , and w t ). 

Thus, we could use a multiple regression to determine (in logarithmic scale) an expected count, c exp , for any given length of source and target text, w s and w t . We obtained the model ( R 2 = 0.979): [^This model was the best of several considered, namely: 

- \(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t}\) 
- \(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t} + w_{s} \times w_{t}\) 
- \(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t} + {w_{s}}^{2} + {w_{t}}^{2} + w_{s} \times w_{t}\) 
- \(c_{exp}\ w_{st},\ \text{where}\ w_{st} = w_{s} + w_{t}\ \text{(treated as a single variable)}\) 

]\(c_{exp} = - 19.591 + 1.311w_{s} + 1.208w_{t}\) We then subtracted the expected count for each source–target pair from the observed count to obtain a residual, which we considered to be a measure of the relative intensity of text reuse for each pair: \(r + c_{obs} - c_{exp}\) 

A positive value of r for a given pair indicates that the observed intensity of text reuse was higher than would be expected for an average pair of texts with those particular word counts — that is, for a pair of texts with no particularly strong or weak intertexual relationship. A negative value of r indicates that the observed intensity of text reuse was lower than average. The further the value deviates from zero, the stronger the evidence for an intensity of reuse above or below average. Thus, we sorted all pairs by their r values, presented in both standardized and non-standardized forms ( Table 3 ). [^The r values are also sorted chronologically by source and target in Table 8 and 9 . Standardized residuals have been adjusted by the standard deviation of the entire set in order to detect statistical outliers. Standardized residuals greater than |2| are normally considered unusual; standardized residual greater than |3| are normally considered statistical outliers. ]We also presented the (non-standardized) r values graphically, partitioning the pairs by source text ( Figure 07 ) and target text ( Figure 12 ), and presented various subsets of the data to aid discussion ( Figures 13–15 , Tables 5–7 ). 

It should be reiterated that r is not a measure of the number of phrases reused for each pair (for which C obs is the most direct measure), but a measure of the intensity of text reuse that takes into account the lengths of the source and target texts in each pair. For instance, the very high C obs value of 7407.3 for the pair of the longest texts in our data set, Ovid, Metamorphoses (78098 words) – Silius Italicus, Punica (76292 words), actually reflects only moderately intense text reuse ( r = 0.146), whereas the very intense reuse ( r = 1.280) of Vergil’s Georgics (14154 words) by Vergil’s later poem, the Aeneid (63719 words) corresponds to a lower C obs value (1974.8) because the texts are shorter. 


## e. Centrality 


For each of our 24 chosen texts, we determined the mean value of r for all pairs involving that text (23 pairs each time), and sorted the texts by the results ( Table 4 ). We considered this to be a measure of the centrality of each of our chosen texts within the 24–text set: that is, how often each text reuses earlier texts and is reused by later texts. A text strongly influenced by its predecessors and influential to its successors would have a higher mean r than a text more peripheral to the literary tradition of Latin hexameter poetry. 


# 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


We have kept two objectives in mind in interpreting our data set. First, we attempt to test whether the results of the automated search and statistical analysis match the conclusions reached by traditional scholarship. Second, we endeavor to identify unexpected results that suggest avenues for future research. We achieve those two objectives when interpreting both general (sections 3.a-b) and specific trends (section 3.c). 


## a. Statistical outliers and centrality 


Three pairs with standardized residuals near or above |3| may be considered statistical outliers ( Georg – Aen , standardized r = 4.571; Met – Mos , 3.830; Ars – Gild , –2.977). These results reflect several phenomena that we will discuss: the influence of author on text reuse ( Georg – Aen , section 3.b), the influence of genre ( Ars – Gild , 3.b), and the importance of Ovid (among others) to late antique hexameter ( Met – Mos , 3.c.iv). For a further 11 pairs, standardized residuals near or above |2| indicate intensity of text reuse markedly above or below average; these results also reflect phenomena that we will discuss. [^Author ( Hon – Stil , Hon – Gild , Ecl – Georg , Gild – Stil , section 3.b), genre (P Sat - Rapt , 3.b), multiple reuse ( Met – Ilias , Ilias – Joh , Aen – Ilias , Georg – Met , Georg – Rapt , 3.c.i), and the influence of Vergil ( Aen – Pun , 3.c.ii). ]These standard statistical thresholds should not be relied upon naively, however: for instance, several pairs for which we would expect a strong intertextual engagement (such as texts written by the same authors) had standardized r values well below 2. 

The centrality scores conformed to expectations ( Table 4 ). The high centrality of the Aeneid (0.133) reflects the importance of Vergil’s works to the subsequent hexameter tradition, while the high centrality of the Ilias Latina (0.186) reflects multiple reuse facilitated by its intense reuse of the Aeneid (see section 3.c.i). The high centrality of the Georgics (0.279) stems from a combination of these factors. All four of Claudian’s works had positive centrality. This reflects not only Claudian’s extensive reuse of his predecessors, but also the influence of authorship on text reuse: each of Claudian’s works had high r values when paired with the other three works, thus increasing their centrality. The low centrality of the works of Horace, Persius, Juvenal, and Lucretius reflects the influence of genre in our data set comprising mainly epic/panegyric texts. Perhaps the most unexpected result is the high centrality of the Achilleid (0.117), which reflects both intense reuse of earlier epic sources and intense reuse by later epic targets. Because the Achilleid is a very short text, certain considerations must be kept in mind (see section 3.c.i). 


## b. General trends 


Unsurprisingly, the most important influence on text reuse intensity was authorship. In all 13 cases where a pair of texts was written by the same author, the reuse intensity was higher than average ( r > 0.000), markedly so in 5 of the cases (standardized r > 2.000); see Figure 13 and Table 5 . Vergil showed the highest intensity of text reuse within his own poems, followed by Claudian, while Horace and Statius reused their own poems with less intensity. Though drawing on a very different data set (a relatively small corpus of Latin hexameter poems), the results are nevertheless broadly comparable to Jockers’ study of the author signal in a corpus of 3500 nineteenth-century novels written in English. Jockers observes that of five "signals "(author, decade, genre, gender, and text), the author signal is the strongest. [^Jockers observes, "the strength of the author signals in this experiment in fact trumps the signals of individual texts — something intuition does not prepare us for. The classifier [program] is more likely to identify the author of a given text segment than it is to correctly assign that same text segment to its novel of origin. "]

A secondary influence on text reuse intensity was genre. Although categorizing Latin poetry by genre is difficult, we may obtain a rough idea of the influence of genre by partitioning the texts of our data set into three genres: didactic, epic/panegyric, and satiric ( Figure 14 ). [^The didactic genre comprised: DRN , Georg , and Astr . The epic/panegyric genre comprised: Aen , Met , BC , Ilias , Arg , Theb , Ach , Pun , Rapt , Hon , Gild , Stil , and Joh . The satiric genre comprised: H Sat , P Sat , and J Sat . This partitioning excludes five texts ( Ecl , Ep , Ars , HE , Mos ) that do not fit into any of the three genres. Including Horace’s Epistles and Ars Poetica in the satiric genre would not alter our conclusions: in fact, the lowest r value in our data set would then comprise an epic/panegyric–satric pair, Ars – Gild ( r = −0.834). ]Within the small didactic and satiric genres, reuse intensity was higher than average for 5 of 6 pairs ( r > 0.000; the exception, H Sat – J Sat , was slight: r = −0.007). Within the much larger (and more diverse) epic/panegyric genre, reuse intensity was higher than average in 66 of 78 pairs; the 12 remaining pairs had only slightly lower than average reuse intensity (standardized r ≥ −0.446). In contrast, pairs comprising texts from different genres tended to display lower than average reuse intensity. The trend was clearest for pairs composed of one epic/panegyric and one satiric text: 37 of 39 pairs had lower than average reuse intensity. [^The exceptions were slight: Ilias – J Sat ( r = 0.053) and J Sat – Hon ( r = 0.045). ]The results conform to the expectations of traditional reading, as epic and satire are the most distant hexameter genres from one another in style and subject matter. Genre is also perhaps the best explanation for the trends seen in the centrality measure ( Table 4 ). Since 13 of 24 texts in our data set belong to the epic/panegyric genre, we would expect each of them to be more central than texts belonging to smaller genres. This is true in most cases; the most notable exception is the Georgics , which had the highest centrality score by far, despite belonging to the didactic genre. We discuss this exceptional text in section 3.c.i. 

Time period appeared to have no influence on text reuse intensity. This is not surprising, since the technical and aesthetic constraints of hexameter poetry discouraged changes in diction or syntax over time. However, it is possible that a future study which controls for much more salient influences such as authorship and genre may discover a subtle influence of time period. 


## c. Specific observations 


The 276 pairs in our data set represent a generically and chronologically diverse collection of texts. Different scholars will accordingly highlight various aspects of the data. We only offer a handful of specific observations here. As with the general trends we observed, these specific results both confirmed that our analysis falls in line with the results of traditional scholarship and identified several possible avenues for future inquiry. For instance, Virgil’s Aeneid predictably emerged as a major influence on subsequent poetry of all periods. Lucretius’ De Natura Rerum was not a prominent verbal resource for later authors. The four Flavian epics were closely related, and late antique poets reused material from previous works in expected ways. The congruence of these results with traditional scholarship supports our contention that several unexpected results are indicators of potential for fruitful further research. For instance, Virgil’s Georgics and the anonymous Ilias Latina scored high in reuse intensity in almost every case. This is probably an indication of frequent multiple allusions to both these texts and the more prominent Aeneid and Metamorphoses (section 3.c.i). The relationship between the Flavian epics and the Aeneid appears to be more creative or original than often allowed, although these terms must be used carefully (see 3.c.ii). Horace’s Ars Poetica seems to have an unexpected influence on Manilius’ Astronomicon, suggesting that didactic sensibility may cut across genre (see 3.c.iii). Finally, Ausonius’ Mosella , usually considered primarily Vergilian in nature, also shows close links with Ovid’s Metamorphoses (3.c.iv). 


## i. Vergil’s Georgics and the Ilias Latina 


The influence of Vergil’s Aeneid on the subsequent tradition of Latin hexameter is well established and reflected in our results. The work had a high centrality score (0.133) and higher than average reuse intensity ( r > 0.000) when paired with 13 of 18 subsequent target texts (the exceptions are BC and the non-epic texts Ars , P Sat , J Sat , and HE ); see Tables 4 and 6 and Figure 11 . However, the results for Vergil’s early work, the Georgics , are even more exceptional. Its centrality score was more than twice as high (0.279) and it had higher than average reuse intensity ( r > 0.000) when paired with 16 of 20 subsequent target texts (the exceptions are the non-epic texts Ep , Ars , P Sat , and J Sat ). These results may seem surprising at first. Although the Georgics is an important text, few would argue that its influence on subsequent Latin literature eclipses that of the Aeneid . But two factors must be kept in mind. First, recall that r is not a measure of the number of phrases reused for each pair (for which C obs is the most direct measure), but a measure of the intensity of text reuse that takes into account the lengths of the texts in each pair. Because the Aeneid is much longer than the Georgics (63719 vs 14154 words), it requires values of C obs over 7 times higher, and thus the reuse of many more phrases, in order to achieve the same residual when paired with any subsequent target text. Subsequent target texts use many more phrases from the Aeneid than from the Georgics in total, [^The average C obs value for the Aeneid paired with all subsequent target texts is 1876.6, compared to 284.6 for the Georgics . ]and the influence of the Aeneid on subsequent literature is therefore more obvious to the reader. Yet the intensity of the reuse is greater for the shorter Georgics . 

The second factor arises from Vergil’s extensive reuse in the Aeneid of his own phrases from the Georgics , which resulted in the highest r value in our data set (1.280), one of three statistical outliers (standardized r = 4.571). Because Vergil’s two texts share many phrases, subsequent target texts that reuse phrases from one Vergilian text will often automatically reuse the same phrase from the other Vergilian text. In practice, subsequent epic poems that reuse phrases from the epic Aeneid will often automatically reuse the same phrase from the Georgics . A similar phenomenon explains the unexpected results for the Ilias Latina . Although no scholar would argue that this minor poem, a rough compression and translation of the Iliad , exerted any discernable influence on Latin literature in antiquity, [^Its influence grew later on: the text is quoted in the late antique commentary on the Thebaid ascribed to Lactantius Placidus, and became popular in the Middle Ages . ]it had a higher centrality score than the Aeneid (0.186) and higher than average reuse intensity ( r > 0.000) when paired with every subsequent target text ( Tables 4 and 6 and Figure 11 ). However, the Ilias Latina also had markedly higher than average reuse intensity (standardized r > 2.000) when paired with both the Aeneid and Ovid’s Metamorphoses , two foundational texts for later Latin literature. [^This is consistent with scholarly observation; see New Pauly s.v. Ilias Latina . ]This suggests that when a subsequent target text reuses phrases from either the Aeneid or the Metamorphoses , it will often automatically reuse the same phrase from the Ilias Latina and thereby increase the r value when paired with that poem. 

The high scores for both the Georgics and Ilias Latina demonstrate that allusion in Latin literature is not always a case of a target text reusing a phrase from a single, specific source text. On the contrary, an allusion to, say, the Aeneid often necessarily entails an allusion to the Georgics , the Ilias Latina , or some other text(s). While scholars routinely privilege one source text at the expense of the others for the sake of interpretation, the automatic searches of Tesserae do not. This egalitarian interpretive practice is not very suitable in the case of the Ilias Latina , a minor text rightly subordinated to the sources it reuses, but it is more suitable in the case of the Georgics , where readers will more often hit upon compelling interpretations by treating the Georgics as a source text on par with the Aeneid . [^For example, see the discussion of the "many mouths "topos . ]Tesserae encourages this kind of interpretation not only by presenting all texts as equal in value, but also by offering the option to perform multi-text searches ( http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/multi-text.php ), where matches between a source–target pair are presented alongside every other instance of the matching phrase in a user-selected set of texts. 


## ii. Post-Vergilian classical epic 


Scholarly interest in post-Vergilian classical epic (the Metamorphoses , Bellum Civile , Argonautica , Thebaid , Achilleid , and Punica ) has roughly tracked the chronology of the epics themselves, with attention paid first to the Metamorphoses and last to the Punica . Similarly, the assumption has often been made that the earlier epics ( Metamorphoses and Bellum Civile ) responded to Vergil’s influence in more creative and original ways, while the four later epics of the Flavian period tended to imitate Vergilian epic less creatively. [^For discussion of the Flavian poets’ gradual return to scholarly favor, see . ]To compare this assumption to the results of our study, we must bear in mind the nature of the text reuse that Tesserae can discover. At its current stage of development, Tesserae identifies only matching phrases with exact repetition of two or more lexemes. It cannot detect allusions signaled by similarity of action, character, or theme, or text reuse involving single significant words or verbal variations. That is, Tesserae preferentially detects exactly the sort of allusions that may be classified as less creative . Thus a high residual indicates not only higher than expected text reuse, but also potentially a less creative allusive relationship. 

Bearing this in mind, the results do not fully support the assumption of declining creativity over time ( Figure 15 and Table 7 ). In contrast, although the intensity of text reuse of both the Georgics and Aeneid by the Argonautica , Thebaid , and Achilleid was higher than average (0.160 ≤ r ≥ 0.299), it was not as high as the intensity of reuse of any of Vergil’s three works by the Metamorphoses (0.323 ≤ r ≥ 0.560). The intensity of reuse of Vergil by the Bellum Civile was even lower: in fact, the intensity of reuse of the Aeneid was slightly lower than average ( r = −0.026). [^Given the low residual, it is remarkable that Tesserae searches reported in identified 25% more interpretively significant instances of verbal reuse in the pair Aeneid – Bellum Civile 1 than the standard philological commentaries. Similar studies for pairs with more intense text reuse (e.g., Aeneid – Metamorphoses ) would presumably be even more successful. ]Thus, it would seem that the intertextual engagement with Vergil’s texts by Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, and Statius are either less intense or more creative (or both) than often assumed. 

The notable exception is the Punica of Silius Italicus, which had much higher than average intensity of text reuse when paired with the Georgics ( r = 0.433) and Aeneid ( r = 0.540). This is consistent with the assumption of an uncreative intertextual relationship, and inconsistent with recent claims about the Punica ’s originality. [^E.g., "Compared with other writers of Latin epic, [Silius] tends to eschew signposting his intertexts by the technique of "quotation ", that is, by repeating complete phrases or other word collocations from earlier poems. He prefers to signal the intertextual connection by alternative means, in particular, by coincidence of situation and detail rather than wording and, occasionally, by more explicit hints. "]It must be acknowledged, however, that originality and creativity are subjective concepts, which are not directly measured by r values. A high r value for a given pair indicates only that the number of matching phrases of two or more lexemes was greater than expected for an average pair of texts with the same word counts. It does not indicate, for instance, a paucity of other kinds of subtler intertextuality (text reuse with verbal variation, or similarities of action, theme, or character). Nor does it take into account the context into which the lexemes are redeployed: a poet may, for instance quote a predecessor’s words exactly, but in a completely different and original context. 

Other observations may be made about the results for the four Flavian epics. The high r values for the epics when paired with the Georgics (0.160 ≤ r ≥ 0.433) may be influenced by factors discussed in section 3.c.i, but scholars have begun to interpret the relationship between these texts more aggressively (Pagán 2015), and our results support this line of inquiry. The Metamorphoses and Bellum Civile have often been interpreted as important texts for the Flavian epics; however, although the intensity of text reuse for the eight relevant pairs was usually higher than average ( r ≥ −0.075), it was usually only moderately so, approximately on par with the intensity of reuse for the epics when paired with the Eclogues , a text rarely argued to be important to Flavian epic. Again, this does not argue against a strong intertextual engagement between the Metamorphoses , Bellum Civile , and Flavian epics; it may instead suggest that future investigations should focus on allusions not signalled by the obvious text reuse that Tesserae discovers. 

The intertextual relationship between the four Flavian epics has been the subject of recent study, and this line of inquiry is supported by our results. The intensity of the Thebaid ’s reuse of the Argonautica was slightly higher than average, on par with the Thebaid ’s reuse of the Metamorphoses ( r = 0.064, 0.037). The intensity of the Achilleid ’s reuse of the Argonautica was much higher than average, on par with the Achilleid ’s reuse of the Aeneid ( r = 0.279, 0.289).While the intertextual relationship between the Thebaid and Argonautica has been well studied, the relationship between the Achilleid and Argonautica has not; [^Parkes on the Achilleid and Argonautica is an exception . For the Thebaid and Argonautica , see , with bibliography. ]future work in this vein could be productive. Unsurprisingly, the intensity of reuse of Statius’ Thebaid by Statius’ later Achilleid was higher than average ( r = 0.141), but it was lower than 11 of the 12 remaining intra-author pairs ( Figure 13 and Table 5 ). This low reuse cannot be explained purely by the divergent subject matter and style of Statius’ two epics: Vergil’s Eclogues and Aeneid are at least as divergent, but had a higher r value (0.224). Finally, the r value for the pair Achilleid – Punica was very high (0.410). [^The relative dating of these two epics is uncertain. This study has treated the Achilleid as the source, but the two epics may well have been composed concurrently and influenced one another . ]This was unexpected. Research on the intertextual relationship between Statius’ and Silius’ works has focused on the pair Thebaid – Punica , [^
Marks argues for "bi-directional influence "between the two works . 
]but these results suggest more attention should be paid to the Achilleid . In all discussion of the Achilleid , however, we should keep in mind that it is much shorter than the other three Flavian epics; therefore, the considerations that applied to the Georgics in section 3.c.i apply here. 


## iii. Didactic and satiric hexameter 


Hardie’s study of the reception of Lucretius makes a strong and well-received case for the fundamental contribution of the De Rerum Natura to succeeding poetry from the Augustan poets through Milton’s Paradise Lost . No reader would dispute the conceptual and formal importance of the DRN to the Latin hexameter tradition. Features of later hexameter poetry such as sententiae , multiple explanations, and similes from the natural world all bear the marks of the Epicurean poet’s mode of argumentation. Yet the vocabulary of the DRN was not mined as extensively as the other foundational works of Republican and Augustan poetry, as can be seen from our results (centrality = −0.151, r < 0.000 when paired with 21 of 23 succeeding target texts; Figure 11 ). The only positive r values resulted from pairings with other didactic works: Vergil’s Georgics ( r = 0.230) and Manilius’ Astronomica ( r = 0.023). While these results are consistent with the observed influence of genre on text reuse (section 3.b), the low r values overall demonstrate the difference between the importance of Lucretius’ poem as a conceptual resource and its importance as a verbal resource. 

Volk’s study of the Astronomica makes a series of valuable observations about Manilius’ thematic adaptations of Lucretius, Vergil, and Ovid . Those thematic adaptations were accompanied by verbal reuse only for Vergil in our results. Vergil’s Georgics yielded the highest reuse intensity ( r = 0.342), followed by the Eclogues ( r = 0.307). Unexpectedly, Horace’s Ars Poetica had the next highest r value (0.213). As the Ars is one of the shortest poems in our data set, the considerations that applied to the Georgics in section 3.c.i apply here. Yet there may be hitherto unexplored verbal connections between the poem on composing poetry and the poem of the stars, likely in the addresses of the didactic narrator. The intensity of reuse of the DRN was higher than average, but only negligibly so ( r = 0.023). The intensity of text reuse of the Astronomica by later texts was low, suggesting a limited influence on the language of subsequent classical hexameter tradition. 

The inclusion of the Satires of Horace, Persius, and Juvenal (H Sat , P Sat , J Sat ) in this study permits us to begin investigation of the influence of genre on text reuse in Latin hexameter. As mentioned above (section 3.b), the author signal is a stronger determinant than the genre signal for intensity of text reuse, as evidenced by higher r values for pairs of texts written by Horace than inter-author pairs within the satiric genre. [^Ep – Ars ( r = 0.354), H Sat – Ep (0.259), H Sat – Ars (0.041) vs. H Sat – P Sat (0.210), H Sat – J Sat (−0.007), P Sat – J Sat (0.137). ]But the importance of genre was especially marked when pairing epic/panegyric with satiric texts, where 37 of 39 pairs had lower than average reuse intensity ( r < 0.000), including the lowest r values in our data set ( Figure 14 ). [^H Sat – Rapt ( r = −0.485), Aen – P Sat ( r = −0.537), P Sat – Rapt ( r = −0.579). The lowest pair, Ars – Gild (−0.834), was one of three statistical outliers (section 3.a); although we did not class Horace’s Ars Poetica as a satire, it shares has stylistic features of the genre. ]These results indicate a strong separation between the genres, related to satire’s pedestrian vocabulary and everyday concerns, which contrast with the more elevated style and subject matter of epic. 


## iv. Late antiquity 


The tremendous influence of Vergil and Ovid on the hexameter poems of late antiquity has been well recognized in prior scholarship, but has been typically studied from the perspective of theme, character, and subject. The present study permits some initial quantification of the intensity of text reuse between these poems and those occurring earlier in the hexameter tradition. 

Prior scholarship has identified Ausonius’ Mosella as primarily Vergilian in character, with several secondary influences, but has not heretofore been able to quantify the nature of Ausonius’ reuse of his predecessors’ texts. [^Gruber’s comments are representative of a long tradition of Ausonius commentary: "Sprachlich und thematisch ist Vergil stets gegenwärtig. In jahrzehntelanger Lehrtätigkeit, in deren Mitte der Vergilerklärung stand, hat Ausonius diesen Dichter so verinnerlicht, daβ ihm nicht nur seine Worte, sondern die gesamte Thematik seiner Werke zur Verfügung stehen. Aber auch Lukrez, Horaz und Ovid gehören zum sprachlichen Fundus. Von den Autoren der frühen Kaiserzeit ist vor allem Statius sprachliches und thematisches Vorbild. Dazu kommen Lukan, Silius Italicus, Valerius Flaccus, und Martial ". One of the goals of the present study is to place on an objective footing such statements of the relative importance of a given text as an overall verbal resource for its successors. ]In our study, the intensity of text reuse of Ovid’s Metamorphoses by the Mosella was markedly higher than average (standardized r > 2.000). This pairing had the highest r value of any two independently authored texts ( r = 1.073), and second only to Vergil’s reuse of the Georgics in the Aeneid ( r = 1.280). The intensity of reuse of Vergil’s works was decidedly lower ( Georgics , r = 0.260; Aeneid , r = 0.115). The intensity of reuse of Statius’ Achilleid and Silius Italicus’ Punica was slightly above average ( r = 0.104 and 0.028), but lower than that of Manilius’ Astronomica and the Ilias Latina ( r = 0.130 and 0.120; for the latter, see section 3.c.i). Intensity of reuse was lower than average ( r < 0.000) for Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura , Lucan’s Bellum Civile , Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica , and Statius’ Thebaid . The centos entirely composed of phrases adapted from Vergil’s works that appear in this period represent a new level of engagement with the foundational texts of the genre . Ausonius’ Cento Nuptialis , the best known of the centos, is available on Tesserae , but was excluded in this study, since its artificially high reuse rates of Vergil’s works would have produced extreme outliers that would have distorted our results. 

As observed above (section 3.b), the works of Claudian are evidence for the strength of the author signal. Four of the top fifteen r values in our data set were derived from pairing works of Claudian ( Hon – Stil , Hon – Gild , Gild – Stil , and Rapt – Hon ; 0.461 ≤ r ≥ 0.716). The lower position of the De Raptu Proserpinae among the pairings of Claudian’s works ( Rapt – Hon , Rapt – Gild , Rapt – Stil ; 0.243 ≤ r ≥ 0.461) may suggest that Claudian’s self-reuse is strongest among works in a similar genre (panegyric rather than mythological epic). We are hesitant to draw firm conclusions, however, about the relative importance of the author and genre signals with so few data. Claudian’s rates of reuse of his Augustan predecessors present a similar story to that told in the scholarly literature . For instance, Vergil’s Georgics ( r = 0.538) and Aeneid ( r = 0.326) had high reuse intensity when paired with Claudian’s mythological De Raptu Proserpinae . The intensity of reuse of Statius’ Achilleid was also high ( r = 0.426), which accords with the importance of Statius as an intermediary between the Augustans and the poets of late antiquity. As Kaufmann observes, "Claudian, possibly inspired by Ausonius, [was] the trendsetter for the increased interest in Statius’ poetry by the later poets ". An unexpected but plausible result is the importance of Lucan’s Bellum Civile to Claudian’s historical panegyrics, Gild ( r = 0.351) and Hon ( r = 0.278). 

We also included Juvencus’ Historia Evangelica , a fourth-century Christian epic, and Corippus’ Johannis , a sixth-century historical epic, in the data set. Both the Johannis ’ high rates of reuse of Vergil and Claudian and the HE ’s low rates of reuse of classical pagan poetry (with the exception of the Georgics and Ilias Latina ) conform to the expectations set by the scholarly literature. [^Hofmann ( New Pauly s.v. Corippus, Flavius Cresconius ) calls Corippus "the last great practitioner of the Roman epic… in his use of language and his narrative skill, "and cites Vergil and Claudian as the poet’s primary classical influences. Juvencus’ Historia Evangelica differs from all other texts in the data set due to its Biblical subject matter, and it should accordingly come as no surprise that exhibits both low rates of reuse and low centrality. Schmidt ( New Pauly s.v. Iuvencus, C. Vettius Aquilinus ) lists only Vergil as a relevant source for Juvencus. See , who observes "roughly speaking, allusions to Vergil outnumber allusions to all other writers combined by at least five to one "(11 n. 63). ]


# 4. CONCLUSIONS 


We chose to begin by studying a selected corpus of Latin hexameter poems because relationships between works in this super-genre have been the most closely studied of all intertextual relationships in ancient literature. We are able to compare the information about the relative rates of reuse of texts in Table 3 to a long tradition of qualitative discussion of allusion by Latinists. We provisionally conclude that a majority of the results conform to the statements typically made by poetry scholars about the significance of various intertextual relationships in the Latin hexameter tradition. For instance, the author signal is one of the strongest determinants of intensity of text reuse, the works of Ovid and Vergil are the most important verbal resources for the later works of the tradition, and satiric hexameter is strongly separated from the other hexameter genres in terms of reuse. If it is accepted that the high level of correlation between our quantified results and the scholarly tradition’s qualitative assessments provides a strong vote of confidence for our methodology, then we can begin to explore the significance of unexpected findings. These include (a) the importance of Vergil’s Georgics to the later tradition, (b) the indications of multiple reuse visible in the Ilias Latina , (c) the relatively low reuse of Vergil by Lucan, Valerius, and Statius, and (d) the intense reuse of Ovid’s Metamorphoses by Ausonius’ Mosella. 

This is a first step in algorithmic criticism of the hexameter super-genre . As observed in the Introduction, Tesserae has some limitations which reflect its current state of development, and others which reflect the nature of Latin poetry. In this initial study, we confirmed the value of the lexeme-matching approach by comparing it to the traditional critical narrative of relationships among Latin hexameter poems. Our goal is to model a system of relationships between texts that can frame critics’ discussions of the role of individual poems within the tradition. As Drucker observes, "on the surface, a model seems static. In reality it is, like any form, a provocation for a reading, an intervention, an interpretive act ". In Drucker’s terms, Tesserae modeling is a dynamic rather than static approach to textual analysis. New data sets can easily be constructed, whether by using different Tesserae parameters or changing the texts in the group under analysis. These future analyses will produce new and different perceptions of the system of relationships among Latin literary texts in other genres, or between other genres and the hexameter super-genre.

# notes

[^1]:  See, for example, , , and  for points of entry
                    to the study of intertextuality in Latin literature.
[^2]:  All translations are by the authors.
[^3]:  Because Latin is a
                    highly inflected language, the same lexeme may occur in many different inflected
                    forms. For example, percutio may appear as
                        percussus (struck), percutimus (we strike), percusserant (they had
                        struck), etc. Traditional literary interpretation may privilege
                    specific morphological forms, such as the opening words of Vergil’s Aeneid  (arma
                        uirumque), which are frequently adapted by later poets, but more
                    often the various inflected forms of a lexeme may be considered to be the same.
                        Tesserae converts all inflected forms to a
                    single lemma (e.g., percussus and percussum are treated as percutio) and so does not permit analysis of individual inflected
                    forms.
[^4]:  See section 2.b for discussion of the
                    scoring system.
[^5]:  Recent commentaries (such as , , and ) note the
                    verbal parallel with Aeneid 7.550, but do not offer
                    a literary interpretation of the link. Their reticence is symptomatic of the
                    scholarly tendency to privilege certain allusions (here, Aeneid 9.197) over others in interpretation. The impartial
                    automatic searches of Tesserae encourage an
                    interpretive style that is both less hierarchical and less committed to
                    authorial intention.
[^6]:  The dates of texts mostly follow
                            those found in Brill’s New Pauly, and
                            depart in some cases from the dates used by the Tesserae to assign source and target text status for each
                            pair (http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/blog/authors−and−text−dates/).
                            Where necessary, we manually corrected for the switched source and
                            target. Some dates are uncertain; see, e.g.,  on Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica, or  on Claudian’s De Raptu
                                Proserpinae. Alternative datings would affect our results in
                            some cases, since the calculation of the variable cexp depends on which text in a pair
                            is considered the source and which the target. But the overall effect of
                            any plausible change in dating would be small.
[^7]:  The Tesserae repository is extensive but not complete. Relevant
                            hexameter texts unavailable for the study at this writing include, for
                            example, Ennius’ Annales, the Appendix Vergiliana, the Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus, and the various Latin
                            versions of Aratus’ Phaenomena.
[^8]:  We included Claudian’s De
                                Raptu Proserpinae because it is an important text and
                            because its pentameter preface is short compared to the text as a whole
                            (69 out of 6991 words), and therefore unlikely to noticeably affect our
                            results. 
[^9]:  Ausonius’
                                Precationes, Ordo
                                Urbium Nobilium, and Cento Nuptialis
                            (see section 3.c.iv), and Claudian’s In
                                Consulatum Olybrii et Probini.
[^10]:  False lemma matches also sometimes occur, such
                            as Vergil, Georgics 4.308 ossibus umor ~ Statius,
                                Thebaid 4.698 ora … umor.
                            Here ossibus (bones) and
                                ora (faces) are inflected
                            forms of two different lexemes, both of which share the lemma os. Since such false matches occur
                            infrequently, we did not expect them to affect the results
                            significantly.
[^11]:  These parameters are explained at http://tess−dev.caset.buffalo.edu/html/help_advanced.php.
                                
[^12]:  The regressions yielded the
                            following formulae:
                            \(C_{9} = - 21.191 + 0.057C_{7}\)\(C_{9} = - 17.943 + 0.225C_{8}\)\(C_{9} = 36.958 + 6.168C_{10}\)\(C_{9} = 84.259 + 212.062C_{11}\) We omitted the intercepts, which provide no useful
                            information, and thus obtained a formula for a composite count: 
\(C_{regr} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.168C_{10} + 212.062C_{11}\)
[^13]: The first principal component had weights
                            	\(0.458{\widetilde{C}}_{7} + 0.462{\widetilde{C}}_{8} + 0.465{\widetilde{C}}_{9} + 0.463{\widetilde{C}}_{10} + 0.383{\widetilde{C}}_{11}\) This led to, in original scale, the composite count (which
                            accounts for 90.1% of the total variability): 
                            	$$C_{pca} = 0.458\frac{C_{7}}{4341} + 0.462\frac{C_{8}}{1118} + 0.465\frac{C_{9}}{253} + 0.463\frac{C_{10}}{39} + 0.383\frac{C_{11}}{1} = 10^{- 3}\left( 0.106C_{7} + 0.413C_{8} + 1.839C_{9} + 11.775C_{10} + 447.617C_{11} \right)$$ Further rescaling it such that the weight for C9 became 1, we
                            obtained: 
                            	\(C_{pca} = 0.057C_{7} + 0.225C_{8} + C_{9} + 6.404C_{10} + 243.426C_{11}\)
[^14]:  This
                            model was the best of several considered, namely:
                            \(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t}\)\(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t} + w_{s} \times w_{t}\)\(c_{exp}\ w_{s} + w_{t} + {w_{s}}^{2} + {w_{t}}^{2} + w_{s} \times w_{t}\)\(c_{exp}\ w_{st},\ \text{where}\ w_{st} = w_{s} + w_{t}\ \text{(treated as a single variable)}\)
[^15]:  The r values are also sorted chronologically by
                            source and target in Table 8 and 9. Standardized residuals have been adjusted
                            by the standard deviation of the entire set in order to detect
                            statistical outliers. Standardized residuals greater than |2| are
                            normally considered unusual; standardized residual greater than |3| are
                            normally considered statistical outliers.

                            observes, the strength of the
                                    author signals in this experiment in fact trumps the signals of
                                    individual texts — something intuition does not prepare us for.
                                    The classifier [program] is more likely to identify the author
                                    of a given text segment than it is to correctly assign that same
                                    text segment to its novel of origin.
[^18]:  The didactic genre comprised: DRN, Georg, and
                                Astr. The epic/panegyric genre
                            comprised: Aen, Met, BC, Ilias, Arg, Theb, Ach, Pun, Rapt, Hon, Gild, Stil, and Joh.
                            The satiric genre comprised: HSat, PSat, and JSat.
                            This partitioning excludes five texts (Ecl,
                                Ep, Ars,
                                HE, Mos)
                            that do not fit into any of the three genres. Including Horace’s Epistles and Ars
                                Poetica in the satiric genre would not alter our
                            conclusions: in fact, the lowest r value in our
                            data set would then comprise an epic/panegyric–satric pair, Ars – Gild (r = −0.834).
[^19]:  The exceptions were slight: Ilias – JSat (r = 0.053) and JSat
                            – Hon (r =
                            0.045).
[^20]:  The average
                                Cobs value for the
                                Aeneid paired with all subsequent
                            target texts is 1876.6, compared to 284.6 for the Georgics.
[^21]:  Its influence grew later on: the text
                            is quoted in the late antique commentary on the Thebaid ascribed to Lactantius Placidus, and became popular
                            in the Middle Ages .

[^25]:  Given the low residual, it is
                            remarkable that Tesserae searches reported
                            in  identified 25% more interpretively
                            significant instances of verbal reuse in the pair Aeneid – Bellum Civile 1 than
                            the standard philological commentaries. Similar studies for pairs with
                            more intense text reuse (e.g., Aeneid –
                                 Metamorphoses) would presumably be
                            even more successful.
[^26]:  E.g., Compared with other writers
                                    of Latin epic, [Silius] tends to eschew signposting his
                                    intertexts by the technique of quotation, that is, by
                                    repeating complete phrases or other word collocations from
                                    earlier poems. He prefers to signal the intertextual connection
                                    by alternative means, in particular, by coincidence of situation
                                    and detail rather than wording and, occasionally, by more
                                    explicit hints.

[^28]:  The
                            relative dating of these two epics is uncertain. This study has treated
                            the Achilleid as the source, but the two
                            epics may well have been composed concurrently and influenced one
                            another .

[^32]:  Gruber’s
                            comments are representative of a long tradition of Ausonius commentary: Sprachlich und thematisch
                                    ist Vergil stets gegenwärtig. In jahrzehntelanger Lehrtätigkeit,
                                    in deren Mitte der Vergilerklärung stand, hat Ausonius diesen
                                    Dichter so verinnerlicht, daβ ihm nicht nur seine Worte, sondern
                                    die gesamte Thematik seiner Werke zur Verfügung stehen. Aber
                                    auch Lukrez, Horaz und Ovid gehören zum sprachlichen Fundus. Von
                                    den Autoren der frühen Kaiserzeit ist vor allem Statius
                                    sprachliches und thematisches Vorbild. Dazu kommen Lukan, Silius
                                    Italicus, Valerius Flaccus, und Martial. One of the goals of the present study is to place on an
                            objective footing such statements of the relative importance of a given
                            text as an overall verbal resource for its successors.
[^33]:  Hofmann (New Pauly s.v.
                                Corippus, Flavius Cresconius) calls
                            Corippus the last great
                                practitioner of the Roman epic… in his use of language and his
                                narrative skill, and cites Vergil and Claudian as the poet’s
                            primary classical influences. Juvencus’ Historia
                                Evangelica differs from all other texts in the data set due
                            to its Biblical subject matter, and it should accordingly come as no
                            surprise that exhibits both low rates of reuse and low centrality.
                            Schmidt (New Pauly s.v. Iuvencus, C. Vettius Aquilinus) lists only
                            Vergil as a relevant source for Juvencus. See , who observes roughly speaking, allusions to Vergil
                                outnumber allusions to all other writers combined by at least five
                                to one (11 n. 63).
