Reaction of Japanese scientists to Fukushima Japanologists would like to investigate the reactions of Japanese researchers on social media to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. They would like to crawl their tweets, but lack a list of the researchers' Twitter profiles. A query in TweetsKB for Twitter profiles with a profile URL of the Japanese academic second-level domain ac.uk results in more than 6,000 Twitter profiles that can very likely be assigned to Japanese researchers or research institutes. In the further course, this list could be used to crawl and further analyze the tweets of the profiles.
