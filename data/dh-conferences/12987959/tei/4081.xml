Introduction

Texts not only carry factual, but also affective information, such as expressions of joy or grief. In the humanities, especially literary studies, emotion expression and elicitation (often in texts from prior language stages) have been focused on in many contributions (see, e.g., Carroll and Gibson (2011), Poppe (2012), Hillebrand (2011)).

Similarly, in natural language processing (NLP), emotion analytics have developed into an active area of research (Liu, 2015). Nevertheless, there is little previous work explicitly addressing emotion in historical language and the specific methodological problems this raises. Hamilton et al. (2016) as well as Cook and Stevenson (2010) presented methods for identifying amelioration and pejoration of words. Acerbi et al. (2013) and Bentley et al. (2014) demonstrated the potential of emotion analysis for the Digital Humanities (DH) by linking temporal emotion patterns in texts to major sociopolitical events and trends in the 20th century.

Our work goes beyond these studies in two ways: we claim to be more adequate as we combine these two approaches to analyze non-contemporary text based on time-specific lexical resources. We also claim to be more informative as we employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model of emotion (Bradley and Lang, 1994) instead of simple polarity (positiveness/negativeness) alone. We have already shown the latter to be beneficial in DH applications (Buechel et al., 2016a). We hope that our work will be a step towards a new set of tools especially beneficial for areas such as literary studies (e.g., in distant reading (Moretti, 2013)) or history of mind.

Methods

The VAD model of emotion assumes that affective states can be described relative to three emotional dimensions, i.e., Valence (corresponding to the concept of polarity, see above), Arousal (the degree of excitement or calmness) and Dominance (feeling in or out of control of a social situation). The VAD dimensions allow for a more fine-grained modeling than polarity alone, e.g., words like orgasm and relaxed have similar Valence but opposing Arousal values (Bradley and Lang, 1999). Formally, the VAD model constitutes a three-dimensional vector space illustrated by Figure 1 (Buechel and Hahn, 2016).

The association of words with a VAD score is captured in emotion lexicons. These can either be empirically determined by aggregating subjective judgments of several human subjects; or they can be semiautomatically constructed allowing for greater size but reducing accuracy on individual words. For the semi-automatic construction, the typical approach is to expand an existing lexicon (the seed lexicon) based on word similarity (see below). There are several competing expansion algorithms. Cook and Stevenson (2010) were the first to describe expansion algorithms for the induction of the emotion value of words for non-contemporary language stages by using word similarity values determined from historical corpora.

Extending this approach, we compared several emotion induction algorithms, viz., those by Turney and Littman (2003), Hamilton et al. (2016), and Bestgen (2008). The former two were slightly modified to make them deal with numerical input values (for a more detailed description of these methods, see

Buechel et al. (2016b) and Hamilton et al. (2016)).

We used point-wise mutual information with singular value decomposition (Levy et al, 2015; SVDPPMI) to measure word similarity, since it turned out to be superior for DH applications in previous work (Hell-rich and Hahn, 2016). We used the German ANGST lexicon (Schmidtke et al., 2014) as seed. The individual algorithms were evaluated by comparing our induced historical lexicons against judgments of knowledgeable PhD students from the humanities. For this task, we asked them to make their assessments as if they were contemporary readers from the respective time period. The Turney-Littman algorithm performed best in this set-up and was thus employed for all subsequent analyses.

Experiments

For demonstration purposes, we here apply our methodology to the core corpus of the Deutsches Textarchiv (DTA; Geyken, 2013, TCF version from May 11, 2016) [German Text Archive], a well-curated and balanced collection of historical German texts. We analyzed texts created between 1690 and 1899, splitting the resulting corpus into seven slices (each spanning 30 years) to achieve similarly sized and sufficiently large subcorpora for further processing. We computed word similarities within each of these slices and then applied the Turney-Littman expansion algorithm, thus creating seven distinct emotion lexicons, each describing the emotion of words for its specific period. Given these temporally stratified lexicons, we claim that shifts in emotion association of words can be traced over time by comparing the emotion values a word exhibits in different lexicons. To validate this claim, we selected the words for which we could compute similarity scores in each time step (as these methods are more accurate for high-frequency words, rare words were excluded from our study) and standardized their VAD values for each lexicon and dimension (VAD).

We illustrate this approach with an example from

Figure 2. It displays an overall amelioration of Sünde [sin] whose onset roughly coincides with the age of enlightenment—often understood as the starting point of secularization (Sheehan, 2003), although care must be taken when interpreting these word course graphs since noise can be introduced from various sources (such as word similarity and emotion induction algorithms); both strongly depend on the amount of data available for each time step. This observation is in line with well-known findings from descriptive lexicography (Grimm and Grimm, 1942). The same semantic shift can also be discovered by a more established method, namely collocation analysis.

Table 1 reveals that Sünde, at the end of our examination period, has acquired an additional moral-bourgeois meaning facet (implied, e.g., by Ausschweifung [excess], Ärgernis [nuisance] and Laster [vice]) which was not present in the beginning. There, only the religious sense is traceable.

Going one step further, we then used these lexicons to examine how emotion is distributed over literary texts in the DTA in the course of time. We employed the Jena Emotion Analysis System (JEmAS; Buechel and Hahn, 2016), an open-source tool for emotion measurement using a configurable VAD lexicon. We processed each DTA text with the period-aligned lexicon,

leading to the main methodological contribution of our work: linking the research areas of automatically inducing historical word emotion (e.g., Hamilton et al., 2016) and emotion prediction in historical text (e.g., Acerbi et al., 2013).

We scaled the resulting emotion values within each VAD dimension tracing the development of the three principal literary forms—Narrative, Lyric, and Drama—in German literature between 1690 and 1899. For each of the seven 30-year periods (organized in rows), we created three scatterplots (one for each pair of the VAD dimensions; organized in columns) resulting in 21 plots in total (Figure 3). Each data point represents one text—color and shape represent membership to the respective form.

It is evident from the plots how the distinction of the individual forms increases and decreases in emotional terms in the course of time. This application differs from typical stylometric approaches since we employ emotional features instead of word counts. We find the most distinct emotional patterns between 1780 to 1809 (approximately covering the Weimar Classicism) and between 1870 to 1899 (covering the late German Realism). Drama displays consistently more Arousal than Lyric and Narrative since 1750, whereas Lyric seems to be the most positive class (Valence) expressing the least control (Dominance). Of course, the examination of the DTA offers many more intriguing findings, however, for brevity, we limit ourselves here to presenting examples.

Conclusion


■ Lyric • Narrative a Drama

In this contribution, we described a novel methodological framework for quantifying emotion in noncontemporary text. Applying this approach to a 210-years section of the German DTA corpus, we find clear emotional signals for temporally evolving distinctions between the principal literary forms, viz. Narrative,

Lyric, and Drama. All resources and software we developed for this work are publicly available.
