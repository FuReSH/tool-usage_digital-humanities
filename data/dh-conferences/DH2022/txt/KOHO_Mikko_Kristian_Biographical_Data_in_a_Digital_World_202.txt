Biographical and prosopographical (Verboven et al., 2007) data are invaluable sources for historical research as they provide us with essential information on thousands of historical figures: from the cultural heroes of a nation to the many thousands of other significant, yet lesser-known figures who were influential in domains such as the arts, politics, humanities, or natural sciences. Their historical life paths can provide crucial context for tangible heritage objects, which have been created, owned, or influenced by historical actors, or which depict or refer to them. The events of individual biographies can further be aggregated into (histories of) larger contextual composites: groups (e.g., guilds, family histories), institutions (e.g., art schools, universities, religious orders, political movements, companies) and regional entities (from cities to whole countries). 

Computational analysis of biographies has opened up new and interesting research directions (Warren, 2018; Fokkens et al., 2017; Tamper et al., 2022). Individuals share common characteristics that can be relatively easily identified and used for information retrieval and data analysis, such as date of birth, occupation, social networks, and locations. Tools and approaches from the digital humanities can be used for both quantitative analyses of such data and for providing leads for more qualitative research questions. New methods of spatial analysis may result in new research questions. 


# Workshop Goals 


This workshop has two main goals. First, previous events on biographical data and digital humanities have revealed that groups working in this domain have different strengths. Though many groups bring researchers from different domains together, some groups mainly consist of domain experts with a lot of knowledge of history, library studies or literature. Other teams are primarily made up of researchers specialized in automatic analysis, formal modeling or visualization. Bringing these groups together increases insights for both types of groups. Technical experts contribute insights on best practices to deal with typical challenges of the domain. Domain experts on what analyses they need, which potential technological challenges are problematic for their research questions and which are not. Second, there is keen interest in cross-national research on biographical information. Most resources are national resources and though many are open, sharing information also means understanding each other’s data representation, linking related information, etc. 

The Biographical Data Workshop: modeling, sharing and analyzing people’s lives held at Digital Humanities 2016 in Krakow led to valuable steps on both these points. Among others, the first steps were made that ultimately led to active international collaboration (e.g., the InTaVia project: https://intavia.eu/ ). Our motivation for organizing this follow-up is two-fold. First, the advances of methods and availability of new resources in the last six years leads us to expect that new interactive sessions of knowledge exchange will have the same beneficiary effect as previous events. Second, the workshop and Biographical Data in a Digital World conference series were, in terms of participants, rather European centric with some participants from America. It is our hope that a workshop at the current location will strengthen connections with researchers from Asia. In addition to the general increase of the network of expertise in this domain, steps towards connecting resources for Asia would open new horizons for new comparative research. 


# Workshop Organization 


The workshop will be divided into three sessions.  


## Preliminary schedule 



- (morning) The participating researchers get the chance to present their work. Depending on the number of submissions, this will be done through (short) presentations or in two poster sessions (where we aim to schedule posters of researchers of existing networks in the same session, to increase options for new connections). 
- (afternoon) The session consists of two interactive themed sessions. In the first round, we have technically oriented themes (data linking and sharing, data analysis and data visualization), where technical experts meet with various domain experts. In the second round, sessions are organized around use cases from the humanities, where humanity scholars meet with a team with different technical expertise. 
- (afternoon) Work groups will share their insights from the interactive sessions with the rest of the participants. 



## Submissions, proceedings, and workshop participation 


We solicit abstract submissions for the poster session through its own call for participation. Possibilities of peer-reviewed proceedings based on the workshop will be discussed with participants during the workshop. 

The contributions will be submitted through the main conference ConfTool system: https://www.conftool.pro/dh2022/ .  At least one author of each paper needs to register to the DH 2022 conference in order to participate in the workshop. The workshop is open for all conference participants. We reach out for close collaboration with the ADHO Geohumanities SIG ( https://geohumanities.org/ ). 


## Logistics 



### Important dates 



- March 4: Call for abstracts and requests for participation 
- April 14: Deadline for abstracts 
- April 29: Notification of acceptance (peer-review results) 
- July 25/26: The workshop takes place 



### Intended audience 


The target audience of the workshop are researchers working with biographical or prosopographical data. The audience is expected to consist of DH-focused researchers and computer scientists, as well as social science and humanities researchers. 


### Expected number of participants 


Estimating the number of participants physically present is difficult due to COVID, but the previous BD workshops have had dozens of attending participants; there will be more with the planned possibility for online access. 


### Intended length 


One day. 


### Budget 


The workshop is self-financing.
